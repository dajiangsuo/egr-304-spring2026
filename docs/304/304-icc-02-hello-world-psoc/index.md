| USB mini B cable                      | 1            | included in PSoC kit      |

## Completed Prior to Class

*Complete all of the steps below prior to the demonstration of proficiency.*

Note: You may use either a [PSoC 4 Pioneer Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-042/?utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-dev_kit) or a [PSoC 4 BLE Pioneer Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-042-ble-a/?utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-dev_kit) to complete this assignment. You will be using the BLE Pioneer Kit for your team project.

1. If you don't have a PSoC 4 Pioneer Kit (BLE or regular), you can check one out from PRLTA 109.
1. If you have not completed it already, follow the instructions in the [EGR 304 Software Install](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/egr304-software-stack/) page on the Embedded Systems Design website to download the full software stack, including PSoC Creator, the IDE for the PSoC microcontroller

    > *If you do not have a laptop that you can bring in for demonstration, you can use one of the computers in PRLTA 103*

## Completed in Class

1. Complete the [PSoC Hello World Lab](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/psoc-hello-world/).
1. *(not for a check off)* Practice measuring the supply voltage for the Pioneer Kit using an Agilent benchtop (not handheld) multimeter.<br> *Hint:* Check the Pioneer Kit Guide on the main product page on the Cypress website for information on where the power pins are.
    
    Next, you will modify the project to make a button enable or disable the blinking of the LED.

    > *Note:* The LED should blink at the same frequency as it did above, but only when the button is pressed.

1. Duplicate the project and add a Digital Input Pin connected to ```P0[7] SCB1:SPI:SS0, WAKEUP```. This is connected to ```SW2 P0[7]``` on the Pioneer Kit. On the BLE Pioneer Kit, ```SW2``` is connected to ```P2[7]```. Make sure the Drive mode of the input pin is set to ```Resistive pull up``` so

    > *Note:* Workspace explorer will have two projects open now, make sure you are in the correct project for pins, main.c etc. To select the appropriate project, navigate to it in the workspace explorer and select "activate project"

1. Finish modifying the project so that the LED blinks only when the button is pressed. For an example project that uses ```SW2```, see the element14 [oscilloscope project](https://community.element14.com/products/devtools/psoc4pioneerkit/f/forum/21143/psoc-4-pioneer-kit-community-project-17---2-channel-oscope-with-graphicslcd). To better understand how switches work and ways to mitigate "bouncing", learn about [switch debouncing](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/switch-bounce-how-to-deal-with-it/).

## Individual Demonstration of Proficiency

In class, demonstrate the following **live** to a member of the Teaching Team by the end of class:

1. Connect the Pioneer Kit (or Pioneer BLE Kit) to your computer and launch PSoC Creator. Open your first Blinking LED project, compile, and download it to the Pioneer Kit.
1. Demonstrate your first Blinking LED project working correctly.
1. Open your second Blinking LED + Button project, compile, and download it to the (BLE) Pioneer Kit.
1. Demonstrate your second Blinking LED + Button project working correctly.

**A live demonstration by the end of class is required. No late demonstrations will be accepted.**

## Part 2. Objectives

To individually demonstrate proficiency in installing and running the Cypress PSoC Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools to program sample code onto a microcontroller, and to modify that code and surrounding hardware to add additional functionality.

## Prior to Demonstration of Proficiency

*Complete all of the steps below prior to the demonstration of proficiency.*

### 1.0 Getting Started

In this assignment, you may use either the CY8CKIT-042 or CY8CKIT-042-BLE evaluation boards. It is recommended that you lay out the large components prior to wiring to ensure sufficient space on your breadboard.

### 2.0 Onboard Button, LEDs, and Morse Code

1. Study the following critical information and concepts:

    | **Critical Information and Concepts**                                        | **Importance**                                                                                                                                                                                         |
    | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | a.  Which ports on the PSoC the *onboard* LEDs and button are connected to. | Needed in order to control LEDs and read the button in software. Can be found in the Appendix of the Prototyping Kit Guide, or noted on the PSoC board itself.                                         |
    | b.  What International Morse Code is and how it was used.                    | Needed to understand the format and purpose of Morse Code. Summary can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code).                                                            |
    | c.  How to represent your initials in Morse code.                            | Needed in order to program an LED to display your initials in Morse Code. Can be found in this [Introduction on Morse Code](http://students.cs.ucl.ac.uk/schoolslab/projects/PY2/introduction.html). |

1. Connect the CY8CKIT-042 to your computer via USB
1. In PSoC Creator, create a new project for the CY8CKIT-042 (or CY8CKIT-042-BLE) and save it in a new workspace for Homework 2.
1. Create two (2) Digital Output pins and one (1) Digital Input pin in the Top Design.
    1. In the configuration pane, disable the hardware connection for each pin and set "Drive mode" to "Resistive pull up".
    1. In the Design Wide Resources > Pins window, connect the output pins to two different ports that map to LEDs onboard the CY8CKIT-042 (or CY8CKIT-042-BLE).
    1. In the Design Wide Resources > Pins window, connect the input pin to the port that maps to the user switch onboard the PSoC board.
1. Using a [Morse Code Translator](https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html), determine the pattern needed to send your initials (e.g., Dr.Jordan's are SJ) in Morse Code.
1. Open ```main.c``` and add code to the ```for(;;)``` loop that does the following:
    1. Turns the first LED on for 1 second, and then off for 1 second. The first LED should then remain off for steps b - d.
    1. Waits indefinitely for the button to be pressed (**not held**).

        > *Hint:* In the Top Design, right-click on one of the I/O pins and choose "Open Datasheet..." and scroll to the Application Programming Interface section to learn about the code used to read from an input pin. Then, use the code with a ```while()``` loop to wait for the button press.

    1. Turns the second LED on and off as needed to display your initials (first and last) in Morse Code. A "dot" should be 500 ms (so per the [rules of Morse Code](http://students.cs.ucl.ac.uk/schoolslab/projects/PY2/introduction.html), a "dot" would be represented with an LED being on for 500 ms and off for another 500 ms.
    1. Waits for 5 seconds before repeating steps a - d. This sequence should repeat as long as the microcontroller is powered.

## 3.0 Custom PSoC Symbol

1. Create a schematic for the CY8CKIT-143A BLE Module (Same footprint and pinout as the CY8CKIT-142). Following the resources for KiCad$^1$ or Cadence above,

    ![Figure: CY8CKIT-143A BLE Module](image33.jpg){style="max-height:200px;"}

    1. Create your own custom symbol for the CY8CKIT-143A BLE Module, including all connections for the 2x10 and 2x12 female headers found on the board. (Your board should include male headers.) **Do not create a symbol for the raw CY8C4248LQI-BL583 IC, you will be using the CY8CKIT-143A BLE module**
        * The symbol should include your initials in the symbol name *so that your **initials are visible** when the symbol is added to schematics.*
        * Pin Names should be identical to the names found in the CY8CKIT-143A manual
        * Pin type should be accurately specified in the symbol definition.<br>*KiCad$^1$:* See [Common Pin Types and their Meanings](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/kicad-common-pin-types/)
        * Specific pin numbering is not given in the datasheet. Number your pins in a consistent and orderly manner.
        * Save your new symbol into a copy of the custom library you created in HW1. Make sure you add that library to your HW2 project and update the project to have a project symbol table. This can be done in the symbol editor by selecting the library, clicking "Save As..." and saving it to your HW2 project folder. Make sure to "Add new project symbol table" in the process.
        * None of the other (non-header) pins should be added.
    1. Add the BLE module to a schematic.
    1. Add all necessary components for minimum viable circuit. This includes:

        ![Figure](image22.jpg){style="max-height:200px;"}

        * A power connector (e.g., a through-hole barrel jack) so you can connect an external power supply to the board.
        * 0.1 µF [bypass capacitors](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/bypass-capacitor-basics/) on **every** power pin connecting to the processor module (unless otherwise specified in the datasheet).
        * HEADERx pins (where x is determined by the number of pins required to select the right header length) to connect parts of your teammates' circuits to your microcontroller
        * At least one debugging LED (through-hole or surface mount) with a current-limiting resistor (surface mount) attached to an unused microcontroller I/O pin.
        * At least one [pushbutton with a pull-up resistor](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/pull-down-resistors/) (through-hole button, surface mount resistor) for debugging.

        > *KiCad$^1$:* Wherever possible, use the "US" version of parts, including "R_US" instead of "R", "C_US" instead of "C", and "C_Polarized_US" instead of "C_Polarized", etc.

    1. Review this [short schematic checklist](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/schematic-checklist/) to ensure your design isn't missing any common mistakes
1. Export your schematic to PDF and package your files for submission to Canvas

    > *KiCad$^1$:* Follow the instructions for [Packaging KiCad$^1$ Files for Submission](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/packaging-kicad-files-for-submission/)
    >
    > *Cadence:*Follow the instructions for [Packaging Cadence Files for Submission](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/packaging-cadence-files-for-submission/)

## Individual Demonstration of Proficiency

You must complete a live demonstration individually, either in office hours or in class if time permits. Demonstrations can be done up to the last office hours on the due date noted in Canvas.  **No late demonstrations will be accepted**

1. Compile, download, and demonstrate your solution to Part 2.0 above, where the code should turn on and off an onboard LED, wait for the onboard button to be pressed, and then flash your initials in Morse code. Confirm the pattern using a [Morse Code Translator](https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** May I use the [PSoC 4 BLE Pioneer Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-042-ble-a/?utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-dev_kit) instead of the [PSoC 4 Pioneer Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-042/?utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-dev_kit)?

**A:** Yes. If you are using the BLE Pioneer Kit, the LED pins are: Red = ```P2[6]```, Blue = ```P3[7]```, Green = ```P3[6]```. The switch is on ```P2[7]```.

**Q:** How do I choose the correct PSoC when creating a new project? The interface is slightly different from the tutorial.s

**A:** Click the "Target Device" radio button and choose "<Launch Device Selector...>" from the drop-down menu. Then, choose the part number that matches with your specific PSoC. (Hint: The part number of the microcontroller is written on the top of the chip, and is sometimes written near the chip on the printed circuit board in the silkscreen).

**Q:** How do I change the target device for a PSoC project that I already created?

**A:** In PSoC Creator, right-click on your project in the Workspace Explorer and choose "Device Selector...". Select the new device to match the part number printed on the circuit board.

**Q:** Something is wrong with my PSoC. I have followed the PDF instructions and videos online, but my LED still won't blink and PSoC Creator can't find a target to program. What should I do?

**A:** Try the following:

1. Borrow a classmate's PSoC and see if it works on your computer. If it does, you may have a bad PSoC

1. Come into office hours so the teaching team can help you debug.

**I can't find my workspace/project in PSoC Creator**

* C files, top design files, etc. are saved in project files
* Project files are saved in workspaces
* Workspaces are saved in the folder "PSoC Creator"
* The PSoC Creator folder can be found in the Documents folder of the user account
* Click ```*.cywrk``` to open a workspace
* Click ```*.cyprj``` to open a project

**How do I read an API?**

* ```void functionName(string descriptiveName)``
    * ```void``` = return value, it can be nothing (```void```) in which case it cannot be set or assigned to a variable, otherwise it will have a datatype such as ```uint8```, which can be stored in a variable of the same type
    * ```functionName``` = the name of the function, in pin and PWM read/writes, the first part (```Pin_*``` or ```TCPWM_*```) must be the name of the pin as defined in the top design (e.g. ```PIN_1``` -> ```PIN_1_Read()```)
    * ```string``` = expected datatype of the parameter (the value passed into the function), other datatypes but not an extensive list: ```int```, ```uint8```, ```uint16```, ```uint32``
    * ```descriptiveName``` = a variable name describing what the expected value(s) are (e.g. ```*_Write``` has the parameter ```uint8``` value and the function call might be ```PIN_1_Write(50)```)

**What is a ```uint8```?**

* ```u``` = unsigned (only positive numbers)
* ```int``` = integer (only whole numbers)
* ```8``` = number of bits (8 bits =  0 - 2<sup>8</sup>-1)

**Is there an auto-formatter in PSoC Creator?**

* No, you must format your own code

**PSoC Creator can't find my device**

* Unplug the device and plug it back in
* Restart PSoC Creator
* Restart computer
* Try a different USB cable. (The cable that came with your kit is a special USB power + data cable. Many phone charger cables only provide power).
* Try a different computer

**Debug Target does not match/is not compatible with project's selected device**

* Unplug the board
* Find the onboard toggle switch and flip it (it should not be on BLE)
* Plug the board back in to see if it is resolved
* In PSoC Creator, right-click on the project in the workspace explorer and choose "Device Selector". Make sure CY8C4147AZI-S475 is selected. (Or, rebuild your project from scratch making sure to choose the correct device at the beginning).

**I'm missing a window in PSoC Creator/I accidentally closed a pane I needed!**

* In PSoC Creator, go to the Window menu and select "Reset Layout"

**PSoC Creator is building the wrong project!**

* Set your current workspace to default
* Set the active project to the project that needs to be built (right click on the project in the workspace window)

**Symptoms / Remedies**

*Debugging is a process of systematically double-checking your assumptions, because if everything was correct then it would be working. See below for some common symptoms and possible debugging remedies.*

*My PSoC port isn't working*

* Try a different port
* Check that the pin is set up correctly according to the assignment instructions
* The above is correct but still not working? Check the continuity of the pins to ensure the soldering quality is not causing the problem

*My program won't build (Code errors)*

* Does every open curly bracket (```{``) have a closing partner (```}``)?
* Does every statement (not condition or loop) have a semi-colon (```;``)?
* Were the functions called correctly?
* Are the loops/conditional statements written correctly?
* Read the error logs from the earliest error.
* Use the line numbers in the error logs to find out where, and the message to tell what the error might be (missing ```;``,```{``, ```}``, incorrect function name (```PIN_NAME_functionname()```), missing parenthesis around the if condition, missing parenthesis to signify a function, etc.)

*My program won't build (Top Design/Pin setup errors)*

* Are the pins and other components set up as instructed by the assignment?
* Check the connection(s) of components and the PWM module
* Check that the port/pin is able to do PWM through the pin/port setup dropdown

*My onboard LED/Button isn't working*

* Choose a different LED/button
* Ensure components were set up in PSoC Creator as instructed by the assignment
* Did you try the onboard LEDs or the LEDs near the CapSense pads? Either should work
* Test the pieces individually/one at a time (i.e. just the LED blinking, then turn on the LED when the button is pushed/held, etc.) before combining them

*My external LED/Button isn't working*

* Is there power?
* Is the circuit complete?
* Are the pins set up correctly in PSoC Creator?
* Are the anode/cathode of the LED in the correct orientation? (Current flows in the direction of the arrow in an LED).
* Check that there isn't a short in the circuit
* Check the resistor(s) being used are the correct ones
* Use a different external LED
* Use a different external button
* Is a wire broken?
* Try making the onboard LED work with the external button
* Try making the external LED work without the external button
* Try making the button work on its own using an onboard LED
* If none of the above resolve the issue, create a new PSoC project from scratch and redo the part

*My code doesn't work as it should*

* Confirm line by line what makes sense/is supposed to be there
* Swap/flip values (trial by experimentation)
* Try isolating pieces of the code to debug it a little bit at a time (i.e. just the LED flip, then just the dot of the morse code, etc.)
* Read the code aloud to someone even if they don't understand to find tiny human mistakes (see also: rubber ducking)
* Chances are the code does exactly what you tell it. So maybe you're not telling it what to do in the right order, otherwise, check your wiring for external components

*My LED on/off values are inverted?*

* Make sure your LEDs are set up correctly in PSoC Creator

*Nothing works/I've tried everything here*

* Try starting a new project and redo everything (carefully)
