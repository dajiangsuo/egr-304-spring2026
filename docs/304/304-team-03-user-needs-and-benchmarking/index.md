title: User Needs and Benchmarking
---

***Team Assignment***

## Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to distill user needs revealed during the stakeholder interviews and distill those needs into a weighted set of design objectives.

## Instructions

1. **Identify User Needs**

    1. **Interpret** the notes and insights collected by your team from all stakeholder interviews as a list of *user needs*.

        Go through the notes taken and insights discovered by your team. *Interpret* what was said by the stakeholder(s). Don't infer a **solution**, (you will do that soon), just convert what you heard directly into a need. Stay positive: say what the device *does* (rather than what it *doesn't do*).

        > **Example:** "We've tried a commercial product before, but the batteries always died before the end of the session" → "The product can remain powered through at least one session" (the need statement avoids "batteries" in the statement)

        > **Example:** "Sometimes our volunteers aren't very technically savvy" → "The device requires little to no training to use."

    2. **Identify** whether the need you wrote down is "explicit" or "latent" (see "Types of User Needs" posts above).

        > **Tip:** instead of converting a stakeholder's statement into a specific solution, describe the needed attributes more generically. For example, instead of "Users start the device using its microphone", try "the device can interact with sounds in the room."

    3. The result of this process should produce **at least 40 user needs**.
2. **Voices of Customers (VOC) Benchmarking**

    Your team must benchmark a *minimum* of 5 existing commercial products related to the product you are developing. Consider products that may solve the entire problem that your team has identified (e.g., a direct competitor), as well as products that may not solve the entire problem but have some interesting features that you could use in your design (e.g., the Internet connection capability of a vending machine). In addition to commercial solutions, your benchmarks should include patents (see Resources above).

    1. *Review* the voice of the customer article linked above or the suggested textbook.
    2. *Conduct* a search with Google, on Amazon, or elsewhere. Keywords are important -- the right keywords will help you find related products. The wrong keywords may put you on the wrong course.

        > *Record* each search conducted. Include the keywords used and a link to the results page.

    3. *Identify* the top five related products that have sufficient reviews to collect data with. This can be the result of multiple searches with variations of keywords used.
    4. For each product, *read* through the 4-5-star ratings and the 1-2-star ratings. Identify the *most often repeated* and the *most helpful* statements from both positive and negative reviews.

        > *Suggestion:* Try to find common ground when looking through reviews...are users saying the same thing in different ways? Are there any "expert users" who give more information about the situation or context they are using the product in? Try to highlight those.

    5. *Summarize*. For each product, list at least three positive statements of the product and three negative statements.
    6. *Convert* each statement to (typically multiple) user needs statements. Identify whether the need you wrote down is "explicit" or "latent". (see "Types of User Needs" posts above or the suggested textbook)

        > ***Suggestion:** See the example in the [Appendix](#appendix-voc-benchmarking-example).*

3. **Organize**, consolidate, and group needs statements collected from the above tasks.

    1. Using sticky notes (you will need to photograph your progress) or whiteboard/slide software, create a note for each need statement.

        > ***Take a picture/screenshot of the notes at this stage***

    1. Group needs into categories. Combine identical needs by revising the need statement. Give each grouping of needs a unique category, *again avoiding an assumption of the technical solution*.

        Next, add a "meta" need for each group (highlight or bold to differentiate). For example, you could collect needs about speaker volume, lighting requirements, pinch points, power requirements into a "safety" category, with a need statement of "the product interacts safely with people of all ages."

        > ***Take a picture/screenshot of the notes at this stage***

    1. **Rank** needs using your notes and your team's best judgment. This does not have to result in a numbered list, but a way to indicate relative importance (1-3 stars).

        > *During a more lengthy design process, this would be a great opportunity to get additional feedback of users' importance with a short survey. See "Quantifying User Needs" resources above, or the suggested textbook*

        > ***Take a picture/screenshot of the notes at this stage***

        Ensure you have documented the evolution of this process from beginning to end. Take a picture/screenshot of the notes

        * when all the notes have been  added
        * after grouping
        * after ranking

4. **Compile** your sticky notes and VOC benchmarking into an ordered list of user needs, with meta-needs and ranking.

    > You should have sorted and prioritized at least 100 user needs

| "I am a STEM teacher and bought a large quantity of these kits and I am disgusted by how easily the motor breaks. 12 years in STEM schools and this product is at the bottom of my list. The ladybug platform, as we call it, needs some reimagining and the materials simply can't handle the wear and tear of a classroom. Sad that I spend my own money on this with so little we got out of it." | 1.  The kit is robust. (explicit)                       |
