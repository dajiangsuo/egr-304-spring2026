title: Product Requirements Document
---

***Team Assignment***

## Introduction

Product requirements documents are one way to develop, rationalize, and specify in engineering terms the requirements of your product. Developing product requirements comes after identifying user needs, where an engineering team converts what they heard from the user into a set of engineering requirements that follow the SMART rule: **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant, and **T**ime-bound.

This assignment asks you to read more on product requirements documents and for your team to create its own. Pay special attention to the references to decision matrices, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), and other tools with more information linked below.

## Instructions

1. Read this [article](https://formlabs.com/blog/product-requirements-document-prd-with-template/) on Product Requirements Documents.

2. Create a copy of the template provided, and develop your own product requirements document.

3. Include all sections provided by the template up to but not including the Appendices.

    1. Include at least two use cases, from the perspectives of how users interact with the product in either 1) two particular types of venues, 2) two different interaction examples, or 3) two different stakeholders that interact with the product (e.g. patient and therapist).

    1. Include the following design aspects:

        - Hardware / Product Design (the latter of which will be outsourced to an external designer)
        - Software / Functionality
        - Interactivity & User Experience
        - Customization
        - Manufacturing
        - Safety (Feel free to include any safety regulations you come across in your research)

## Submission Instructions

This work will be used in multiple ways. It will be reviewed for feedback in class on the date given in Canvas, so please be prepared to discuss it with a member of the teaching team.

### Canvas Submission

Submit the document in PDF format on [Canvas](https://canvas.asu.edu) by the deadline given for your section. *Do not submit links to Google documents.* It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission to Canvas was successful. Late Canvas submissions will be graded per the policy in the syllabus. No credit will be awarded for assignments not submitted to Canvas.

## Subsequent Uses of this document

### Classtime

This document should be made available during classtime for review by the teaching team on the due date. We will provide feedback, which will be your responsibility to integrate and address in subsequent submissions.

### Report

This document will also be added to your team's report and maintained throughout the semester. It will be graded for additional feedback in upcoming project checkpoints.

### Checkpoints

This document will be summarized in your checkpoint 1 presentation.

## Grading

As described above in Assignment description

| **Item**                               | **Points** |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Full (complete) draft submitted to Canvas and brought to class | 50         |

## Most Common Mistakes

1. Writing performance specifications that are not measurable. If a criterion is not measurable (e.g., "soft") how will you know whether or not you were successful? Research appropriate ways to measure each of your specifications to precisely define success.

2. Poorly formatting specifications such that tables span across many pages.
