***Team Assignment***

## Objectives

* To develop a virtual collaboration space for your team to share design documents.

## Resources

* Canvas discussion board

## Instructions

### Team Folder Structure

Each team will create and maintain a virtual folder structure containing the latest versions of the documents listed below. You must use a plain Google Drive folder, not a Google "Shared Drive". This specification and the naming convention below is intentional to support our administration of the course. Follow it exactly as specified.

> ***Do not create and share a Google "Shared Drive" with us.***

1. Go to [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com/a/asu.edu) and create a folder named "```EGR304 F24 Team 123 - Project Name```", where "123" is your three-digit team number and "Project Name" is a 1-3 word description of your project.

    > Examples:
    >
    > * EGR304 F24 Team 105 - Automated Suspenders
    > * EGR304 F24 Team 207 - Monkey Fitbit

2. Share your folder with the following people (as editors):

    * All of your team members
    * The teaching team, including:
        * Daniel Aukes <daukes@asu.edu>
        * Kevin Nichols <kevin.nichols@asu.edu>
        * Shubham Mungekar <smungeka@asu.edu>
        * Asrith Pandreka <apandrek@asu.edu>, 
        * Zeel Prakashkumar Bhanderi <zbhander@asu.edu>, 
        * Ean Potter <ehpotter@asu.edu>, 
        * Justin Hanson <jthanso6@asu.edu>, 
        * Jillian Brooke <jlbrooke@asu.edu>, 
        * Alex Gutierrez <maguti43@asu.edu>, 
        * Manuel Garcia <mgarci84@asu.edu>, 

    > <daukes@asu.edu>,<kevin.nichols@asu.edu>,<apandrek@asu.edu>, <zbhander@asu.edu>, <ehpotter@asu.edu>, <jthanso6@asu.edu>, <jlbrooke@asu.edu>, <maguti43@asu.edu>, <mgarci84@asu.edu>, <smungeka@asu.edu>

3. Create a folder hierarchy with the following folder names. The bold items indicate folders or files that should be created and/or populated:

    > *Note:* The text after the # is a "comment", do not replicate.

    <p></p>

    > *Note:* You don't need to add folders for things that do not yet exist, like the example code and CAD subfolders. This is how we *want* things structured *when* you create them.
