## Instructions

### Presentation

1. Create a six-minute PowerPoint presentation (roughly 1 slide / minute):
    1. Team organization (30 sec)
        1. Team members
        1. Charter stand-outs. *What are the most important parts of your charter, or what makes it unique?*
        1. Mission statement
    1. Overview of your three design concepts (90 sec)
        1. Picture plus feature overview
    1. Interview questions (60 sec)
        1. Key questions you had prior to interview(s)
        1. Key takeaways based on compiled notes
    1. User needs (60 sec)
        1. Overview of your process
        1. Most unexpected user needs
        1. Sample image of your post-it "board"
    1. Product requirements (60 sec)
        1. Explanation of your process. *How did you convert user needs into requirements?*
        1. "Stand-out" product requirements
    1. Design ideation (60 sec)
        1. Organization of your brainstorm session
        1. Screenshot of your post-it "board" mid-process
2. Practice your presentation to stay within the time limit. (This is a critical skill for engineers asked to present to clients and management.)
3. Record a video of your 6 minute (max) presentation in [PowerPoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP9VJ03s8Gw) or [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360059781332-Getting-started-with-recording). The videos will be shared with both our class and the Fashion class, with feedback provided by the teaching team.

### Team Folder Structure

#### Setup

Please refer to the [Team Repository assignment](/304/304-team-00-team-repository/) for complete instructions on setting up your team folder.

#### Content

1. Add the following folders to your *assignments* folder:
    * ```01-team-organization``
    * ```02-interviews``
    * ```03-user-needs``
    * ```04-product-requirements-document``
    * ```05-design-ideation``
2. Add all contents to each folder, including:
    * ```01-team-organization``
        * Team Organization & Charter assignment document
    * ```02-interviews``
        * Stakeholder interview raw notes
        * Stakeholder interview assignment document
    * ```03-user-needs``
        * User needs assignment document
        * images/whiteboards/slides from generation process
    * ```04-product-requirements-document``
        * Product requirements assignment document
    * ```05-design-ideation``
        * Design ideation assignment document
        * images/whiteboards/slides from generation process
        * Vector-based source files for each design concept

3. Add checkpoint 1 presentation files to the presentations folder, using the naming convention ```2023-09-13-checkpoint-1.pptx``
4. Add any images, videos, CAD, or code you have generated to their respective folders.
5. Move any unsorted floating files to their proper folder.

### Report

Create a final project report document in the report folder, using the naming convention ```team-123-report``` where ```123``` is replaced with your team number.

#### Formatting

Please follow the [report formatting instructions](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/report-formatting-instructions/) found on the embedded systems design website.

#### Content

The purpose of this report is to consolidate all your team's individual assignments into one complete and comprehensive report. Do not remove content from assignments, but if it negatively impacts the flow of the document, feel free to move content to an appendix. In that case, make sure you refer and link to the appendix from the body of the report.

Put new and existing content into the following sections (Do not change the order or organization):

1. **Title page** (1 page). Project name, team number, team members, submission date, university, class, professor
    * This is a great spot to put a link for your team folder as well.
2. **Team Organization:** Include an updated version of your "Team Organization & Charter" assignment, that implements any suggestions made during grading. Include only the following sections in the main body of the report:
    * Team Goals
    * Product Mission Statement

    Don't simply copy and paste the content from the previous assignment; you need to claim ownership of your material by adding context. Convert this assignment into a report format by **adding** "connective tissue", that explains how you agreed on a project charter and mission statement rather than just pasting them in.

    Add the *remaining* sections to a new appendix in the back, titled "Appendix A: Team Organization".

3. **Stakeholder Discovery Interviews:** Include an updated version of your stakholder interview assignment, that implements the suggestions made in your feedback or discussed during class. Don't simply copy and paste the content from the previous assignment; you need to claim ownership of your material by adding context. Justify your process by explaining what you did, and how you completed each step.
    * For example, consider describing in depth, the process by which you developed stakeholder questions, providing an overview of how you conducted interviews, and/or a summary of your team's collected data in a table or figure. Discuss your process for converting interview notes from stakeholders into a list of insights.
4. **User Needs and Benchmarking:** Include an updated version of your user needs & benchmarking assignment, that implements any suggestions made in class, grading, or during checkoff. Don't simply copy and paste the content from the previous assignment; you need to claim ownership of your material by adding context. Explain what you did to identify user needs and how you completed each step
    * For example, how did your team organize, combine, and split needs into the list you arrived at? Justify the process by which your team assigned weights for importance, using both interview notes and internal team discussions.
    * How did you move between each step of your whiteboard / slide / post-it note organization process?
    * How did you rate importance of each user need?
5. **Product Requirements:** Include an updated version of your product requirements document, that implements any suggestions made in class, grading, or during your checkoff presentation. Justify your process by explaining:
    * Discuss the process by which your team converted user needs into specifications.
    * Discuss, with detail, how your design will be assessed according to the "aspects", to ensure your product meets your requirements.
6. **Design Ideation:** Include an updated version of your specifications assignment, that implements any suggestions made in class, grading, or during your checkoff presentation. Justify your process by explaining:
    * What role each team member played in generating ideas.
    * What types of brainstorming worked? What didn't?
    * What was your process for organizing and ranking ideas? Who created or sketched each concept?

## Submission

### Canvas

> You can submit each section of the assignment (PPT, video link, report, Google Drive link) together in a single submission, or in separate submissions to the same assignment.

#### Google Drive Folder

In addition to sharing with the teaching team as requested above, submit a link to your team's Google Drive Folder on [Canvas](http://canvas.asu.edu) by the deadline in Canvas. It is your responsibility to ensure that the submission to Canvas was successful. Late Canvas submissions will be graded per the policy in the syllabus. No credit will be awarded for assignments not submitted to Canvas.

#### Report

Combine the above report sections into a single PDF (required for grading) using the naming convention of ```team-123-report.pdf``` where ```123``` is your team number and submit to Canvas by the deadline in the course calendar. *Do not just submit a link to your folder.* No credit will be awarded for assignments not submitted to Canvas.

#### Presentation Video and File

Include a YouTube or Google Drive link to the video of your presentation with your submission (either in the same submission or a separate submission). Make sure the permissions are set so that the video is viewable by anyone with the link. YouTube videos can be unlisted or public. Also attach your ```PPTX``` file with your submission.
