* Workbenches in the back are clean and in order, please keep them that way. This is part of your     * Workbenches in the back are clean and in order, keep them that way. professionalism
* The way team assignments work is that you need to bring a **completed** assignment to class for feedback. Pass/fail draft leading up to final deadline.
    * last day of class, finals week, last due date for everything

### EGR 304/314 [Course Sequence Requirements](https://embedded-systems-design.bitbucket.io/3x4/course-sequence-requirements/)

* Discuss the concept: build foundation first semester, learn the pattern, spring change the tools towards more professional, industry focused,
* No innovation showcase in the fall
* tools used, innovation showcase, communication tools, software, etc.
* 3 checkpoints: group assignments together, presentations, three natural points in the semester, external feedback from teaching team, hopefully our project stakeholders, and industry professionals (TBD)

### [Submission Best Practices](https://embedded-systems-design.bitbucket.io/3x4/submission-best-practices/)

### Office hours

* complete survey
* What does that mean? Checkoff, what's a checkoff? Query problems regarding HW1

### [*Embedded Systems Design Website*](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/)

* [*https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/fall-2022-software/*](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/fall-2022-software/) (linked in HW1)

        * Cadence is available through myapps.asu.edu
        * New hotfix (will check up on status this week)
    * Want to teach the workflow, and the pattern, not the tool.
    * VPN: use sslvpn.asu.edu
        * Peralta Computers are an alternative if cadence not working; we will confirm it is installed and running
        * Have remote desktop available
        * Persistent profiles (yay)
* coming soon: virtual machines from Fulton, more info soon.

## EGR 304 Project Description

* We are leading you through a traditional design process, please don't arrive at the solution before you've heard the problem.
* Brainstorm questions for the researchers at the end of class (\~10 min)

### [Canvas](https://canvas.asu.edu)

* Assignments
    * In class checkoffs and  most homework assignments are posted
    * Team assignments are rapidly being posted, the first few are available up through checkpoint 1
* Discussion Board, moderated by us
    * expectations for use: if you send us an email, we will respond most likely, unless it is a teaming issue, to check the discussion board and ask there
    * we want to have the same answer for everyone - consistency
    * we want to be able to coordinate our answer among the teaching team
    * more efficient for us to answer once than 44 times.
    * we want you to play a role in answering questions with your class
    * Response times: 24 hours. Set expectations about our lives. Will do the best we can. Teaching team will help fill the gaps
    * professionalism is a must, your grade depends on it.
* Calendar
    * Add feed to your own personal calendar, you'll see assignment deadlines.
    * Go the first two week assignments
    * go through how you check off, and how you submit assignments.
    * Things Due this week
        * CATME teammaker due tomorrow, let us know in advance if you haven't received your email, check your asu email, try signing in with your asurite, read the FAQ!
        * ICC1
        * Team Charter
        * Interview Questions
        * Office Hour Survey

### Next Class

* Bring your parts you just got!
* Be prepared for asking questions of the researchers (30 min), taking notes
* Be prepared for ICC1, read through critical information" section and resources in advance
* **Remember:** ICC's are meant to help you get through technical challenges that you would otherwise get stuck on for hours, so that your homeworks go faster and easier. Therefore, work ahead till you get stuck and bring your questions rather than assume you will get done in a single class session because everyone checking off at the same time will be chaos.
* **Same thing for next Monday and Wednesday**
* **Will send just to them.**

## Week 1 - Wednesday

*Before class: Put (2) 5.1Ω 10W power resistors at each station. We can use the two extra benches in PRLTA 109 as well.*

Please sit with your team

* Classroom Layout

Today there are 3 major tasks to go over: ICC1, Team Repository, and User Interviews

* I hope you came as prepared as possible for ICC1

* Teams should assemble their breadboards at their tables
* If you are ready to test/check off, head to the back. Benefit of being done in advance.
* Everybody should check off on their own breadboard today, but work in pairs with one of their new teammates. No teams of 3 or 4, just 2.
* Voltage should ideally be between 4.9 and 5.1 (+/- 2%). When loaded, the value drops to 4.8V
* Teaching teams will go around the workbenches and check off students.

Teaching Team

* Teaching team will use the checkoff sheet.
* Enter the date completed for each item (there are 3 today), your initials, and any comments about what you saw out of the ordinary.

Topics I to go over with class:

* reading capacitor values
* color codes for resistors -- check your kits
* electrolytic / polar capacitor basics...how to identify the negative pole.
* potentiometers and how they work.  It is actually being used as a variable resistor...poles 1 and 3 are interchangeable.

ICC1

* Voltage should ideally be between 4.9 and 5.1 (+/- 2%). When loaded, the value drops to 4.8V
* If it drops to 3V, it's because R3 was not selected well.
* review a potentiometer

End of Class Roundup

* Please let us know if there is a dead link **anywhere**. We added a lot of content and some of it was added asynchronously to each other...the information is ALL there that you need, so it should be as a fixable annoyance, not an excuse for incomplete work

* Helps you understand how to spend your time. Checkpoints are big. End of the class is big. Initial team assignments should be significant enough to make you do the work but not hurt too much.

End of Class Reminders:

* Team Charters due Wednesday 9/4
* Stakeholder Interview due WEdnesday
* Office hour poll due friday
* Team repository assignment due friday
* Official office hours begin next week
* HW1 Due Sept 6.

## Week 2 - Wednesday

Today is two major tasks: Stakeholder Interviews and ICC2.

* Thank you for such an effective discussion board, please keep it up!
    * Please use emai, not canvas messages.  Notification preferences are not guaranteed to deliver to the person you intend with alerts.
    * We will continue to softly direct you towards it if you email us
    * please keep grading questions and rants to a minimum, this is a forum for help, not twitter.
* Office Hours is filled out
    * please watch for changes as we adjust.
    * working on saturday coverage
* Go over Calendar for the week.
* Check your kit for parts needed in [HW1](https://embedded-systems-design.bitbucket.io/304/304-ind-01-power-supply-schematic/), due Friday.
    * Capacitors
    * PSoC Pioneer Boards
    * Power Supplies
* [User Needs](https://embedded-systems-design.bitbucket.io/304/304-team-03-user-needs-and-benchmarking/)Due Monday.  Go over the assignment.
    * explain the purpose of the assignment
    * Like a brainstorm. Go fast first. organize and consolidate later.
* Get the PSoCs out and all parts for ICC2
* Stakeholder Interviews
    * We will share the results with the class
    * Teaching team will use the checkoff sheet.
    * Enter the date completed for each item (there are 3 today), your initials, and any comments about what you saw out of the ordinary.
    * We are looking for completeness of draft.  Give comments based on what you see.  We will do the first couple together.

## Week 3 - Monday

* What did you like / not like about User needs?
    * acknowledge that this was quick turnaround, and that this is the first iteration of the assignment, and that we want to improve the process.
    * write down what people liked and didn't like.
    * Talk about what's coming up
        * checkpoint 1 will be posted this week.  Discuss what it is;
            * summary of work completed by team in first 4 weeks
            * improvements implemented
            * short overview video converted from powerpoint.
        * product requirements document
            * go from needs to features/aspects.
    * purpose of the assignment
        * Like a brainstorm. Go fast first. organize and consolidate later.
        * this is a low-points assignment; the purpose is to get you iterative feedback cycles from different people over the course of the project.
        * If we can't provide feedback, your results in checkpoint 1 will be worse.
        * We need it due today so you can get feedback today.
    * user needs:
        * yes we need 100 items
        * we need connective tissue
        * we need snap shots from each step
        * this is a brainstorm.  the point is to generate many needs, say "no" very little, and bring in as much signal as possible
        * make sure your benchmarking matches your mission / stakeholders / course requirements.  Yes, you can benchmark against a variety of less-related items, but still keep in mind you have to make a PCB with a sensor and an actuator.
* discussion board
    * what is its purpose?
    * Reduce heresay -- try to improve how you learn about the course.  Go to the source material -- the assignment, the syllabus, or if something is unclear, the discussion board
        * not email
        * don't ask the TAs, they should tell you to look at the assignemnt or ask on the discussion board
    * timing
        * sunday evening is when I check in for monday; we all have other committments, lives, kids, dinner, so keep in mind we can't always answer questions immediately.  Factor that in to when you meet and generate your first questions.

## Week 4 Wednesday

Thank you for working ahead on ICCs. We got a lot of good questions on the discussion board regarding ICC3 late last week and over the weekend.

ICC3 today. We have some soldered motors but not enough for you to hold on to. Feel free to solder your own if we're short. Use a header pin to plug in

<!-- 
Please continue to use the discussion board, there have been some good questions

* the idea is not to grade you off if it is done wrong, but to penalize you if we can't even give feedback.

Go through calendar, discuss Checkpoint1 presentation and file submission

* yes, submit a ppt
* yes, store your presentation in your

Don't leave early if you finish checkoff

## Week 4 Wednesday 
-->

<!-- * Ask everyone to fill out [*this feedback form*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLPjsjYTLKdzX6nE3YK6D1LGTLpaDcm6da32jqQCGk8K9phA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Announcements

* CATME due friday; did you get an email?
* Checkpoint 1 Upcoming: we will distribute all feedback by tonight / tomorrow morning.
* Help and Checkoff go on the board
* ICC3: No, you do not need to re-check off ICC1.  That was for helping you at home, not required for checkoff.

## Week 5 Monday

<!-- * General submission guidelines
    * don't put individual names on team submissions unless we ask. this is a team project
    * avoid bullet points, use whole sentences.
    * Don't use assignment as a template and copy in assignment text. This is your submission, eventually going in your report.
* PSOC review - what is the BLE board, how does it relate to what we're asking for in HW2, and your project?
    * Double header row - how to handle drawing the symbol of that in KiCAD
    * What is a footprint vs symbol? -->

## Week 5 Wednesday

* Some grades released
    * Please review your attendance
* Teaming issues - The option is to split
    * This means more work
    * but more fair
    * if you're all doing the same amount of work, it's best to stay together.
    * if you don't want your team getting a better grade because of the high quality work you're doing, you're pulling the team anyways.
* Please review the syllabus
    * regarding late policy
    * regarding attendance
* please review the project requirements
    * what are we making this semester?
* blocks vs subsystems
* In Class activities
    * Block Diagram Feedback
    * 
    * HW3
* Walkthrough ICC 4
* Draft assignments -- approach to grading
    * we will pull all submissions at 10:30 and review our copies when giving feedback
    * it needs to be consistent across both sections
    * primarily so we can give quality feedback.
    * We are working with the teaching  team to supply 4-5 positive and 4-5 constructive points per session.

## Week 6 Monday

* **Distribute more 10k potentiometers or tell people where they are.**
* Discuss upcomong component selection
* Please review project requirements, and ask questions on canvas.
* Really important that you verify your block diagram with multiple points of feedback
    * one person may not see everything
    * happy to provide more feedback in office hours.


## Week 6 Wednesday

Released most HW assignments through the rest of the semester including:

* Checkpoint 2
* Hardware Implementation
* Software Implementation
* System Verification

Two assignments are unposted but have placeholders

* checkpoint 3
* HW7

* Draft assignments are all/nothing.  This policy is in the syllabus.
* Clarified the course sequence requirements document  with regard to subsystems
    * UART not required this semester
    * Subsystems must be materially different.
    * Clarified microcontroller / voltage regulator.
* Address canvas questions
    * PSoC 4

Is my component compatible?


* check the voltage jumper on the psoc, can operate at 5 or 3.3V
* Input in general
    * Voltage is generally the concern, not current
    * this is because GPIO pins are "high impedance", which means that they are effectively a very high internal resistance, taking little current to sample a signal.
    * ADCs are digitizing the range of voltage they are sampling
        * 8-bits - 255 discrete numbers.  at 5V, that's approximately .02V per division
        * if you have a small range of input values, 
* Analog Input
    * Anything analog input is compatible because it is your job to signal-condition it
    * we are teaching op-amps, but you could use transistors, vacuum tubes, many other technologies
* Digital Input
    * switches - explain pullup or pulldown concept, why you need them
    * explain PSoC4 weak pull up configuration
    * what happens when you have a digital device operating at a higher voltage than expected?
* Output
    * Need to consider current output capabilities
        * if you are trying to draw more current than possible, you will either will destroy your microcontroller, or not be able to supply the desired current, depending on its design
    * Look at the data sheet
        * absolute maximum ratings
        * find the PSoC datasheet: <https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-PSoC_4000T_MCU_datasheet-DataSheet-v09_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c8a44f57b018a799f5fb53b5d>
        * about 25 mA
    * Draw a microcontroller straight to an LED
        * what's wrong?
        * no current limiting resistor for LED
        * no current limit for microcontroller.
    * Draw a microcontroller straight to a motor
        * can't run a motor straight from a microcontroller.
        * Fix the drawing by adding a mosfet
* What's the difference between a BJT and a MOSFET?
    * BJT: current controlled current amplifier
        * limited amplification ability per stage.
    * MOSFET: voltage controlled resistance change.
        * mosfets take a larger voltage to fully turn on, so bad for low-voltage applications

 
<!-- 

## Week 6 Monday

Pass Out the LM324N On Monday


Review the calendar on Canvas

* ICC5 has been moved to next week
* Within the Component selection assignment, the Power budget has been made **optional** for Wednesday, but it will still be **required** for checkpoint 2. If you want feedback, please provide a draft..

Reminders:

* We posted a note on the discussion board last week reminding of the grading policies. It is still worth it to check off icc\'s late, because our late policy applies to in class checkoffs as well. There were some questions last week that indicated people weren\'t sure whether they could check off one day late.
    * For assignments where the checkoff is required, days without office hours don\'t count as late days.

**Review the component selection assignment.** This is the first time we\'ve talked about it in class.

Today is a flex day. Ideas for things to do:

* Prepare for component selection assignment Wednesday. Write your name on the board and we will come around.
* If your team doesn't need your help:
    * Check off icc4 from last week, now due friday
    * Finish HW3 checkoff if you still need time.
    * You can check off homework 3 part 2 whenever, but the due date is still TBD. We will give reasonable notice, just remember not to take your H-bridge off until you've checked off
    * Start working on ICC5 and HW4

**6pm section: Please review block diagram submissions in class today so they can be passed back**

## Week 6 Wednesday

Go over calendar

* Software Proposal assignment released, first submission due next Wed
* Hardware proposal assignment released, first submission due in 2 weeks
* Checkpoint 2 after that. Working on grading checkpoint 1
* Individual HW5 about to be published - convert your subsystem schematic to PCB design

Office Hours expectations

* If you need more help, consider coming in earlier in the week.
* hard for us to plan around last minute learning challenges

Have teaching team walk around and provide feedback on component selection

* formatting should be clear
* should stay away from Amazon parts unless they have a datasheet
* power budget is optional now, required for checkpoint 2. give feedback on it if present
* should match the major components listed in last week's block diagram.

Clarify Four subsystems

[*https://docs.google.com/document/d/12erQoBJRSltsg35KBDPuPtxJDANjaS92uSBMP5RCzwA/edit?usp=sharing*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12erQoBJRSltsg35KBDPuPtxJDANjaS92uSBMP5RCzwA/edit?usp=sharing)

* One subsystem can be PSoC and Power Supply
* That leaves three other subsystems; can do two sensors and one actuator.
* no daughter-boards
* stay away from complex sensors. stick to sensors that will use what you are learning: simple serial and op-amp based analog

Op-Amps Discussion

"Golden Rules" of ideal op amps

* no current flows into or out of the inputs.
* when vout and vin- are connected in a network, vout will be set such that vin+ and vin- are at the same voltage. (up to the limits of vout)

these two rules help you calculate output signal as a function of input.

Run through vout for inverting and non-inverting cases in the homework

Draw example plot of both.

Inverting vs. non-inverting: use cases

* Inverting is great for AC signals about some known zero reference point
* non-inverting is great for amplifying small signals greater than but close to zero.
* other more advanced circuits:
    * summing amp
    * differencing amp
    * integrating amp
    * differentiating amp
    * trans-impedance (convert current to voltage)
    * instrumentation (good for load cells)

HW4 discussion

* Need to check the voltage jumper on your board and make sure it is set to 5V!
* clarified in the assignment
* Ask claire to talk about what we did in 10:30 section

HW5 discussion

* simple passive filters exercise, demonstrate knowledge of oscilloscope and function generator.
* calculate your own R & C value for a given purpose
* can check off in pairs.
* ![](./weekly-course-agenda/image3.jpg){width="6.5in" height="4.875in"}

## Week 7 Monday

Go over calendar

* Go over Hardware proposal assignment
* Go over HW5 in more detail and explain about PCBs and vias

ICC 5

## Week 7 Wednesday

![](./weekly-course-agenda/image1.jpg){width="6.5in" height="4.875in"}

* Reviewed Component selection, this is a critical time for each individual to ensure that they meet their course requirements
    * not daughter boards → sharp distance sensors and ultrasonic rangefinders were the worst offenders but I saw motor driver daughter boards, and others

    * no servos. "linear actuators" behave like servos too so they are out.
    * pushbuttons don't qualify as a subsystem.
    * hall effect sensors and other sensors that require no signal conditioning don't count

Remember, these parts can be purchased but they don't count for anything; takes time and money, so we recommend saving these "extras" till the end, if you have time.

* Go over all pages in the following sections of the website:
    * "Transferring KiCad Schematics to PCB"
    * "PCB Design"

> Briefly introduce each page, in roughly the order they need to know it,,and give context as to why each page is important in their step, in terms of manufacturability, how the milling process works, etc

* Introduce and discuss HW5 & 6 in the context of board design. It's a long way off but we are really switching gears to a new topic and people need to be ready
* PLACE ORDERS once you are certain of your subsystems.
* Finally, spend the last 30 minutes going around to each table and providing a mix of software checkoff and component selection feedback.

## Week 8 Wednesday

* Checkpoint 2 assignment is published. Will Go over Checkpoint 1 feedback and Checkpoint 2 assignment on Monday.
* ICC 6 Will be posted this afternoon, doing it next wed. Will discuss on Monday or on discussion board
* Use [*Hardware Proposal Review*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNlQrb_IZUwzNF4i5wYe3T8rckqwS6wTWvTMNG45Ke34mflw/viewform?usp=sharing) form and (short) [*Schematic Checklist*](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/schematic-checklist-short/) to provide feedback (take whole class)
* We finished 10 minutes before the end; did a roundup of what each team learned that they did not know before.

## Week 9 Monday

## Week 11 Wednesday

We understand you're stressed. We are investing a lot of time in your success and want you to succeed.

* HW6: we will change grading breakdown from:
    * 100%, 90%, 75%, 75%, 50%, 0%
* to:
    * 100%, 90%, 75%, 75%, 65% 55%, 45% 35%\....
* we want you to finish checking off.

We've posted EVERYTHING due this semester except for checkpoint 3.

Discuss upcoming calendar assignments

* ICC7 - next Monday
* Nov 14 - Verification Table and Block Diagram Submission - 2 weeks before final verification on Nov
* Software Implementation - convert your software diagram to function prototypes, if/then statements, and pseudocode
    * Grading and submission instructions still coming, but enough for you to generate some questions.
* HW7 - Install, setup and schematic - draft is posted. Due friday before thanksgiving; this is **better** than the wednesday before thanksgiving
* System Verification - due the Monday of the last week of classes, this is where you show functionality.
    * We use the table you submit. The level of granularity included in your table indicates how much checking off you need to do. Choose your own adventure. Include at least one row/column per subsystem, no more granularity than "major components".
* Checkpoint 3 timing and point value posted, assignment details still on the way
    * presentations - we will change the format so it is more fun and interactive; an internal "innovation showcase"
    * Final checkpoint 3 document submission will be Friday Dec 2

Three columns:

* individual hw6 checkoff
* hardware implementation checkoff - checkoff spreadsheet has a new tab & column for team checkoffs
* HELP

## Week 12 Monday

![](./weekly-course-agenda/image9.jpg){width="3.701258748906387in" height="2.7698162729658793in"}

* Review the calendar and upcoming assignments
* Discuss cadence install instruction updates which I recently made
* Software implementation: I will be updating submission instructions this evening
* Create a check off queue and a questions queue.

## Week 12 Wednesday

![](./weekly-course-agenda/image5.jpg){width="6.5in" height="4.875in"}

* Discuss techniques for populating board (15-20 min)
    * Involve the teaching team in this discussion.
    * Check Power and ground planes and traces first
        * This is the best and only time you will be able to find manufacturing errors related to burrs, design problems that inadvertently connect power and ground, or islands that are not connected.
        * Solder in sockets
            * sockets allow you to separate the solder connection from the valuable IC. Keeps heat away, allows you to test connections without an active device fouling your test
            * We have sockets in peralta
        * Use the lowest heat you need, and for a minimal amount of time
            * Higher heat will damage boards
        * A good connection looks like a cinder cone, not a ball of solder on the end of a pin.
        * What is the hardest to solder? big copper areas or small copper areas? It depends, but big pieces of metal take longer to heat up.
        * Heat the pad and the wire, not just the wire.
        * Use solder flux.
        * Don't plug in the PSoC till the end. This helps keep subsystems separate.
        * if you used jumpers to separate subsystems, keep things separate
        * Check iteratively, as you populate each part.
            * Saves a lot of rework
        * Discuss what solder braid is and how a solder sucker works.
* Sheldon has made the first 5 parts out of \~20 submissinos
* Consider using a power and ground plane rather than two ground planes
* in the future, don't remove islands, it takes more machining time.
* Will significantly reduce the number of traces on your board.

Programming: Go through [*these slides*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mXsUgZlYT5x0gHG_qJbVACfdH_laIUCxd9rXMYyxv8s/edit?usp=share_link)

* when you get to the "Practice Calling functions" slide, open up the debugger and show them how to make a function, how to include a library and use it (math.h).
* Involve the students and ask what they would do.
* The link to the final version is now lo

## Week 13 Monday

* Discuss Calendar. Team Checkoff starts today. We will copy what you submit today and share back with you without edit capabilities
* Only 5 classes before team board needs to be fully validated.
    * pick up your parts!
    * populate your board!
* Checkoff Software Implmementation and provide feedback

## Week 13 Wednesday

> ![](./weekly-course-agenda/image7.jpg){width="3.2343755468066493in" height="2.2847069116360457in"}

* Cadence
    * Remind students about Cadence. Download ASAP if they haven't started
        * There are a couple usb keys with cadence and hotfix loaded up for sharing with students if you need in the shelf in the classroom (see pic)

> ![](./weekly-course-agenda/image8.jpg){width="4.421875546806649in" height="3.3164063867016624in"}

* Ask students what issues they have encountered already with Cadence
    * libraries work a bit different in cadence, need to explicitly add libraries to find parts.

&nbsp;

* We have copied checkoff forms submitted monday and will share them back with students soon. We can start checking teams off. Morning section has two teams checking off already.
* Software Implementation Feedback has [*been returned*](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-EAFWHT5redzqjq9NpcIsGE_vUA_papW?usp=share_link)
* Code Structure.
    * Talk about Sleep, what sleep does -- Nothing!
    * Talk about loops within loops and why they're bad.
    * go over the principles of code structured like [*this*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AwhKN-LynIqHGbKjotiLX8Eun6kLVHgf/view?usp=share_link)
    * How do you do something for a set period of time without using sleep?
        * Use Hardware based Timers and clocks to get time
        * save time as a variable t0
        * calculate current time as the difference between current time and t0
        * if current time \> desired time, execute actions
        * you can do this while continuing to let main() go as fast as possible
        * we'll go over timers and clocks more on Monday, but don't use sleep.
* Check off, question answering, and Cadence work.

## Week 14 Monday

* Course Evaluations are live
    * Really important because it determines resources and problem areas.
    * Helps us plan at school / program levels.
    * We listen to your feedback and change the course based on what we see
    * Here are some examples:
        * Pick your own teams
        * Reducing the "product discovery" portion of the course. Explain why
        * will probably have a more dictated project in the Spring. Will keep some aspects of product discovery
        * ICCs will be distributed throughout the semester.
            * Explain why did we have ICC's bunched up at the beginning? Not everyone knew how the benchtop tools worked. If you recall, those first ICCs and homeworks were the essentials of the four subsystems your board needs.
        * We will be using more serial in the spring. \\
            * We will be adding the ESP32
            * Using python for more high level programming and internet connectivity
            * LCD screen over i2c with plotting functionality
            * Low level sensors will be using I2c or SPI.
    * SO, we listen to evaluations
        * Be constructive. It doesn't help to tear us down. Tell us how to do it better.
* [*Go through PSoC Timer / timing example*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U25U0iWP3Cq_XvGV7Rrf_9eVsE1jGFsN/view?usp=share_link) in class - Bring your PSOC
    * What is an interrupt and what's the concept?
    * Top design consists of one timer and UART.
        * Explain how timer works (counts down and when it hits zero the output changes). Timer preload value is 48000, connected to the High speed clock (48MHz), which means ISR fires each millisecond
        * UART only connected to tx. Need to remove Rx Pin in dialog.
    * Talk about Interrupts (preview of spring topic). ISR connected to TC pin fires an ISR. You can drag in an ISR in top design
        * Interrrupts config menu lets you set priority
        * Walk them through the code generated ISR_1.c, ISR_1.h
    * Walk them through the main code:
        * ISR is in main.c
        * ISR_1_start_ex links the interrupt to my_isr().
        * the if then evaluates the current time and only prints when the current is more than a second since the last print.
        * This concept is a useful way of removing sleep() or internal while loops.
