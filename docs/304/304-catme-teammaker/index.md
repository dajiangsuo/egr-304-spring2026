***Individual Assignment***

## Objectives

To tell us enough about yourself so that we can assign you to a team.

This assignment must be completed ***before*** the deadline stated in ***Canvas*** so that teams may be formed before class the following day. This deadline has been set so that we may address any technical issues you may encounter connecting to your CATME account before the CATME window closes.

    > If you have not received it:
    >
    > 1. Check your spam folder.
    > 2. If your ASU email is forwarded to another non-ASU email address, check your non-ASU email address.
    > 3. If you did not receive this message, go to [https://catme.org/](https://catme.org/) enter your ASU email address (```ASURITE@asu.edu```), and click "Forgot Password" to try and retrieve your CATME password (which is ***different*** than your ASU password).
