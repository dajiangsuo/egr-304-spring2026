title: "Project Checkpoint 2: Design Review"
---

***Team Assignment***

## Introduction

A *design review* is a common industry process during which a design is critiqued by colleagues and stakeholders with the intent of providing critical feedback, discovering errors, and making suggestions of improvements prior to the implementation of a design.

In this activity, your team will both (1) present and discuss your design, and (2) provide feedback on others' designs by asking questions and completing a detailed evaluation checklist.

Checkpoint 2 presentations will be presented on Monday and Wednesday in Cooley Ballroom A, as noted in the course calendar. **Do not come to the classroom on these days.**

The objectives of this checkpoint are to:

1. Update the living project report document and populate it with deliverables for grading.
1. Update the virtual collaboration space where your team shares design documents.
1. Present your project in its current form.
1. Receive detailed feedback on your team's progress.

## Format

Design reviews will span over two days of class. On each day, half of the teams in the class will present their designs for feedback for 25 minutes, twice, to two different groups of students, faculty, and/or industry professionals. The other half of the teams will review the teams that are presenting. Teams that are not presenting will provide feedback through the checkpoint review forms linked above.

Design reviews will be **in-person in Cooley Ballroom A.** Attendance will be taken on both design review days.

**Dress is business casual on both days of design reviews.**

Attendance will be taken on both design review days.

During the design review, you will share links to a Google Slides presentation and updated report with reviewers, and give the presentation using Zoom screen sharing from your computer. Reviewers may ask questions both during and after your presentation.

**Dress is business casual for any part of you visible on camera on both days of design reviews.**

*TT = Teaching Team*

## Prior to the Design Review

Prepare the following deliverables prior to your presentation day:

### Prior to the Design Review: Prepare Presentation

1. Create a 12-minute (max) **Google Slides** presentation with the following sections and store it in a team folder titled "```11-checkpoint-2```".  
   
    > You do not need to pre-record voice narration, as you will be delivering its contents live and in-person.
   
    1. **Project name, team #, team members, external design consultant, and class (15 sec):** Include a hyperlink to your team's updated report (see below).
    1. **Figure of selected product concept (1 min):** Provide a figure/rendering/animation of your product in its current form. Highlight features that satisfy user needs, with labels and arrows. You may update or re-work one of the images from design ideation, or start from scratch if you prefer.
    1. **Block Diagram of your product (2 min):** Discuss each teammate's subsystem and how they connect to achieve project requirements.
    1. **Component Selection (1 - 2 min):** Present only the selected components, not the alternatives.
    1. **Hardware Proposal (4 - 5 min):**  This can be multiple slides or one slide, but make sure that text (e.g., part numbers) on the schematic is readable. Include a slide with your schematic, and also include a hyperlink to a PDF of your schematic so reviewers can zoom in on their computers.
    1. **Software Proposal (1 - 2 min)**
    1. **Questions for reviewers:** Pre-plan questions to ask of your reviewers about your design. For example, ask questions about parts you are unsure about, think there could be a better way to solve a problem, or may not align with the user's needs.
    1. Questions from reviewers
    1. Thank you!
2. Practice your presentation to ensure you can present (without questions) for 12 minutes. All team members must present during part of the design review.
3. Set permissions on the ```11-checkpoint-2``` folder so that anyone with the link can view it. Then create a QR code to the shared link to the folder at the beginning of your design review, so that the reviewers can look at parts in more detail on their own.
1. Some images are too high-resolution for the presentation to permit zooming.  Therefore, add pdf versions of the following documents to the ```11-checkpoint-2``` folder so that guests can follow along and navigate through your documents at their own pace.

    * pdf version of your schematic
    * pdf version of your software diagram
    * pdf version of any other high-res vector images

### Prior to the Design Review: Update Project Report

#### Formatting

We will be grading for format consistency through the use of styles. Please follow the [report formatting instructions](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/report-formatting-instructions/) found on the embedded systems design website.

#### Content

The purpose of this report is to consolidate all your team's individual assignments into one complete and comprehensive report. Do not remove content from assignments, but if it negatively impacts the flow of the document, feel free to move content to an appendix. In that case, make sure you **refer and link** to the appendix from the body of the report.

**Make sure to review your team's feedback on Project Checkpoint 1 and update your report to fix any issues identified.**

## During the Design Review

The design reviews will have the following format. See the full schedule for more detailed information.

1. Presenting and reviewing teams will break out into their respective tables according to the schedule.
1. **Presenting Teams** should designate at least one note taker from their team and take turns presenting and answering questions. One team member should share their screen to show the design documents to reviewers, and also post the link to their Google Slides deck in the chat so that reviewers can look at the presentation at their own pace. All team members (regardless of whether they are in the same physical location or not) must present during part of the design review.
1. **External reviewers** will provide oral feedback in addition to completing a brief feedback form.
1. **Reviewing team members** will be responsible for giving detailed feedback to the presenting teams using the Student Reviewer Forms (in the resources section above). Each reviewing team member should complete a different form.
1. At the end of the first time period (approximately 30 minutes), presenters will remain at their tables and reviewers will return to the main virtual room. This will be repeated again, with each team and external reviewer entering the next room to which they are assigned per the schedule.
1. At the end of the review period we will close the session with thanks to the external reviewers and any common feedback. *(~5 minutes)*

## After the Design Review

### 1. Process Feedback

Based on the notes your team took during the design review and any written feedback received, make a list of action items that your team needs to resolve.

### 2. Update Design and Project Report

Modify your original design documents to correct as many of the errors identified as you can prior to submitting your final design review documents. While it is not required that you address all of the issues prior to report submission, your product (and grade) will be higher if you are able to address all of them.

### 3. Update Team Folder Structure

#### Setup

Please refer to the [Team Repository assignment](/304/304-team-00-team-repository/) for complete instructions on setting up your team folder.

1. Add checkpoint 1 and checkpoint 2 presentation files to their respective presentations folders, using the naming convention from [Checkpoint 1](/304/304-team-06-checkpoint-1/)
1. Add any images, videos, CAD, or code you have generated to their respective folders, according to the naming convention from [Checkpoint 1](/304/304-team-06-checkpoint-1/)
    * ecad - You should start saving ZIP snapshots of your team's PCB design as it evolves.
1. Move any unsorted floating files to their proper folder.

## Submission

### Canvas

#### Google Drive Folder

Unless you have changed folders or did not share your folder according to the instructions in Checkpoint 1, you do not need to re-share with the teaching team.

#### Report

Combine the above report sections into a single PDF (required for grading) named ```team-123-report.pdf``` where ```123``` is your team number and submit to Canvas by the deadline in the course calendar. *Do not just submit a link to your folder.* No credit will be awarded for assignments not submitted to Canvas.

#### Presentation File

Submit a .pptx or .pdf version of your presentation to Canvas. Please refrain from embedding videos for space reasons. Any linked videos must link to a YouTube video rather than Google Drive (to prevent permission errors).
