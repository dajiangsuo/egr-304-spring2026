title: "Stakeholder Discovery: Interviews and Insights"
---

***Team Assignment***

## Introduction

Designing useful solutions requires data from users and other stakeholders to understand the context in which your solution will be used, and to understand stakeholders' needs, which you will later convert into product requirements. In this assignment, you will prepare and conduct interviews with multiple groups of stakeholders and analyze the data to identify user needs.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Prior to the Start of this Assignment

#### Learn about the project and assignment

1. Read the [EGR304 Bicycle Survey][bicycle-survey]
1. Read the [Project Description](/304/project-description/) thoroughly.

#### Learn about user interviews

1. Read the *Talking to Humans* section entitled, "[Who Do You Want to Learn From?](https://s3.amazonaws.com/TalkingtoHumans/Talking+to+Humans.pdf#page=32)" (pp. 32 - 35). This section uses the word "customers" which we will think of as "users" for our project, since we are not selling products to them.  "Stakeholders" refers to the wider community of people to whom this product or device makes an impact, even if they are not the direct user.
1. Read the *Talking to Humans* section entitled, "[What Do You Want to Learn?](https://s3.amazonaws.com/TalkingtoHumans/Talking+to+Humans.pdf#page=36)" (pp. 36 - 43). You will not need to show stakeholders a prototype or present any solutions during the initial interview.
1. Consider adapting some of the questions from the following worksheets to your context (*Note: While the questions below are tailored toward starting a business, the idea of customer/stakeholder discovery is universal regardless of whether you are designing for a client or selling a product.*):
    1. [Trigger Questions: Customer Jobs](http://strategyzr.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/vpd/resources/customer-jobs-trigger-questions.pdf) worksheet from Strategyzer
    1. [Trigger Questions: Customer Pains](http://strategyzr.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/vpd/resources/customer-pains-trigger-questions.pdf) worksheet from Strategyzer
    1. [Trigger Questions: Customer Gains](http://strategyzr.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/vpd/resources/customer-gains-trigger-questions.pdf) worksheet from Strategyzer
    1. [Trigger Questions: Pain Relievers](http://strategyzr.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/vpd/resources/pain-relievers-trigger-questions.pdf) worksheet from Strategyzer
    1. [Trigger Questions: Gain Creators](http://strategyzr.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/vpd/resources/gain-creators-trigger-questions.pdf) worksheet from Strategyzer

## Part 2: Prepare your interview

1. Identify (in paragraph form) **at least two groups** of stakeholders you would like to learn more about.  Justify your selection based on your Team Organization & Charter Assignment.
    > You will need to interview **at least four people** from each group of stakeholders.
1. Compose (write) at least **five additional** team-specific questions related to each group of selected stakeholders and to the goals stated by your team.  Identify to which stakeholder group you will ask each question.  For example,

    | **Question**  | **Applicable To** |
    | :------------ | :---------------- |
    | Question 1... | Riders, Parents   |
    | Question 2... | Drivers           |

    Design questions that will elicit open-ended responses. Avoid questions that can be answered with a yes / no response. Use "how" and "why" follow-up questions to elicit a full response.

    > You will supply the responses to these questions in the "Team Question Response" field.

### Part 3: Conduct Stakeholder Interviews

1. In preparation for the visit, read the following short sections from *Talking to Humans* to help prepare you to get the most valuable data from the experience:
    * "[How to Ensure an Effective Session](https://s3.amazonaws.com/TalkingtoHumans/Talking+to+Humans.pdf#page=52)" (pp. 52 - 57)
    * "[Screwing Up Customer Discovery](https://s3.amazonaws.com/TalkingtoHumans/Talking+to+Humans.pdf#page=76)" (pp. 76 - 79)

* Your team should interview at least four people from two separate groups of stakeholders ($4*2=8$ total).  Enter the responses **yourself** into the [EGR304 Bicycle Survey][bicycle-survey].
* The interview should be held in person.  Each teammate should conduct a share of the interviews.  _It is strongly encouraged to work in groups of 2 or more to ensure adequate notes can be taken._
* During the interview, you should ask your interview questions, listen to the questions that other teammates ask, observe the environment, and take copious notes on what you see, hear, and learn. These notes will be critical for completing **Part 4** of the assignment.

### Part 4: Summarize Stakeholder Tour and Interview Insights

1. Read the *Talking to Humans* section entitled, "[How Do You Make Sense of What You Learn?](https://s3.amazonaws.com/TalkingtoHumans/Talking+to+Humans.pdf#page=58)" (pp. 58 - 64).
1. Analyze the data from your team's notes and write a document describing **at least** 10 meaningful findings/insights that could impact your design.

   > Make sure to number each of your findings or put them in a numbered list of complete sentences or short paragraphs.

## Suggestions for a Better Submission

* Read the assignment carefully.
* Consider who you are talking to. Don't use technical jargon with a non-expert.
* What is our interviewee an expert in? Speak to their expertise, to learn what they know (not what they don't).
* Work together as a team. Don't put your name on your part of the contribution. Improve the whole submission.
