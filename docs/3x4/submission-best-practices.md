## Reports and Documents

Produce a single, monolithic PDF with everything needed included inline. Only PDF format will be accepted for submission of reports. When answering questions, don't just answer the question, phrase the answer in a complete sentence which includes what the question asked. For example:

1.  What is the sum of one and one?

> Two

Instead, provide context and detail in your answer, like this:

1.  What is the sum of one and one?

> Our group found that the sum of one and one is two. This was verified in two ways. First we ran a simulation using the following code....
>
> Second we ran an experiment where we took M&M's and counted how many there were when we put one next to another. We found the answer was two across ten experiments with a mean of 2 and standard deviation of 0.1 M&M's. We attribute the error to the fact that Maxwell ate one.

This will help when you transition from assignment reports to your final report. Please still include the question or at least the question number before your answer for the convenience of the grader.

Other guidelines:

-   Figures and images should be inline with the text, and with detailed subtitles. Use figure numbers when referring to them in the main body of the text. Use colors in figures such that they can print well in both color and black and white. Make sure the colors you use are compatible with grayscale printers.

-   Code Snippets: you may include useful code snippets inline as long as they are well commented and referred to in the main body of the text, but source code must always be supplied in the manner specified below.

-   CAD renderings or screenshots

    -   Photo-realistic renderings look better than screenshots, but take longer to create. These will be *required* for final reports and presentations.

    -   Change background to white before taking screenshots.

    -   Utilize multiple standard orientations (top, right, isometric) in order to provide a clear picture of your design.

    -   Zip and attach source CAD files as specified below

## CAD

Use the File \> "Pack and Go" feature in SolidWorks to include all files required to view parts and assemblies into a single ZIP file. Drawings in .dxf format must be exported to .pdf format and submitted separately. Make sure you include your name and reference the drawings in the report.

## Code

Zip up all files in the folder structure needed to run your code (outside of standard libraries/packages). Indicate any other packages you installed which are required to run it, where you got them, how you installed them (conda, pip, etc), and what version you installed. The professor and TA should be able to run your code using the instructions and files provided. After finishing the code, print output as your name in the last line before submission.

## Presentations

Unless otherwise specified, slides may be submitted in .pptx or .pdf form. If submitting .pptx files, beware of videos with dead links, unembedded fonts, missing codecs, etc. If your videos are not embedded in the PPTX, then we cannot play them.

If submitting PDF files of presentations, include any embedded video files separately as indicated above.

Do not submit links to Google presentations (too many issues with embedded video file access)

## References & Hyperlinks

**Formal APA or IEEE citation format of references are required** rather than hyperlinks, search results, etc. A bibliography should be added to the end of every document that includes citations. Reference managers such as **Mendeley** (<https://www.mendeley.com>) and **Zotero** (<https://www.zotero.org>) can do this formatting for you automatically.

## Schematic and Board Layouts

Follow the [Packaging a Cadence Schematic Project for Submission to Canvas](http://esdresources.blogspot.com/2017/09/packaging-cadence-files-for-submission.html) instructions to create a ZIP archive (including the .OLB library files) of your schematic project and PCB project. Create PDFs of both your schematic and PCB layout. Submit **both** the two PDFs and ZIP archive to this assignment on Canvas by the deadline in Canvas. **Do not submit screenshots.**

### Gerber Files

Follow the [Exporting Gerber Files from Cadence PCB Editor](http://esdresources.blogspot.com/2015/09/exporting-gerber-files-from-cadence.html) instructions to create Gerber and drill files of your design. Combine the Gerber and drill files into a second ZIP archive. Submit the ZIP archive to this assignment on Canvas by the deadline in Canvas.

## Videos

Due to space limitations, please submit videos as YouTube links (not Google Drive Links). Please make sure that the video privacy is set to "unlisted" or "public" rather than "private".
