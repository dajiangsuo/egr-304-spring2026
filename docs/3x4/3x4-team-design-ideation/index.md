## Assignment

<!-- ### 0. Meet With Your External Design Consultant (*EGR 304 Only*)

Your external design consultant is leading the aesthetic design of the project, and your team will be leading the engineering. Meet with your design consultant to learn about the conceptual direction and share feedback and ideas from your team. The ideas you generate for this assignment should be potential engineering implementations of the concept(s) that your design consultant is considering. -->

### 1. Generate Ideas

Read the above articles on design ideation and brainstorming. Perform a product brainstorm to generate a large number of features, concepts, and ideas about what your product *COULD* be. Use sticky notes, a whiteboard, chalkboard, google slides, or similar, to generate ~100 or so brief concepts / features / ideas for your product.

There are some basic rules to brainstorming, spelled out [here](https://lucidspark.com/blog/4-group-brainstorming-techniques):

* Don't criticize any ideas.
* Encourage a wide variety of ideas.
* Build on each other's ideas.
* Don't be afraid to share unrealistic or unconventional ideas.

See the "[Brainstorm Techniques](#7b9jkwk9s0hv)" links above for good ideas on how to generate more ideas.

These two articles share more information on [successful ideation techniques](https://uxplanet.org/whats-the-deal-with-ideation-e02324e95c8) and data on the [effectiveness](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ideation-in-practice/) of ideation and brainstorming.

> Take a snapshot of your board here at this point before you start to rearrange it.

### 2. Sort, Rank, and Group Design Concepts

Some of the most effective phases of ideation come ***after*** the brainstorm session. Seeing innovative patterns in the noise, grouping features in ways other products don't, and re-mixing good ideas into better ideas is often just as effective as coming up with many disjointed ideas. Take some time to discuss your brainstorm.

Next, collect features / ideas into separate bins, representing three separate design concepts. Unused features should not be disposed of, but left on a separate page / area of your board, in case you need more inspiration later. You *may* copy concepts to multiple design concepts, but challenge yourselves to make each concept unique and distinct.

> Take a snapshot of your board here at this point. 

### 3. Create three product concept sketches (or similar)

Develop one visually-engaging representations ***for each of your three*** product concepts. Describe what each concept *does*, and how the features highlighted in each sketch satisfy needs and requirements from prior assignments The purpose of these sketches is to highlight the features grouped into each concept developed above. Possible representations include:

* Physical cardboard / wood / 3-D printed / etc. mockup
    * Take photos of your mockup.
    * Use a **vector based drawing program** to annotate your photos with text boxes and arrows to highlight ***all*** features included in this design concept.

    > See [What is a Vector Image?](https://vimm.com/what-is-a-vector-image/) and [Suggested Drawing Software](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/drawing-software/) on the Embedded Systems Design website.

* A detailed, ***computer-generated, vector-based sketch*** of the product concept
    * **No hand-drawn sketches.**

    > See [What is a Vector Image?](https://vimm.com/what-is-a-vector-image/) and [Suggested Drawing Software](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/drawing-software/) on the Embedded Systems Design website.

* Annotate your photos with text boxes and arrows to highlight ***all*** features included in this design concept.
* Visual *story-based* representation of how your team's design will be used by a user (user experience). Examples include (but not limited to):
    * Computer-generated, vector-based annotated storyboard, comic strip, or graphic novel. Make sure to have at least one human character in the story. **No hand-drawn sketches.**
    * Narrated [stop motion animation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qxLPUOMLJY) telling the story of the product in a single short (<5 minutes) video.
    * Mock print/video advertisement or infomercial for the device and how it solves the problems of the user.

    > As with other representations, ensure ***all*** features and ideas included with the product concept are included in the story, video, ad, etc.

* Other form of representation (*only with prior approval* from your instructor).

## Submission Instructions

This work will be used in multiple ways. It will be reviewed for feedback in class on the date given in Canvas, so please be prepared to discuss it with a member of the teaching team.

### Canvas Submission

Submit the above items in PDF format on [Canvas](https://canvas.asu.edu) by the deadline given for your section. *Do not submit links to Google documents.* It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission to Canvas was successful. Late Canvas submissions will be graded per the policy in the syllabus. No credit will be awarded for assignments not submitted to Canvas.

Please submit vector-based source images in a separate ZIP file.

If you are submitting a video-based representation, please upload it to YouTube (unlisted or public, not private link) and provide a link in your submission to the video. **Do not share Google drive video links** (sharing settings are often incorrect for grading leading to zeros)

## Subsequent Uses of this document

### Classtime

This document should be made available during classtime for review by the teaching team on the due date. We will provide feedback, which will be your responsibility to integrate and address in subsequent submissions.

### Report

This document will also be added to your team's report and maintained throughout the semester. It will be graded for additional feedback in upcoming project checkpoints.

### Checkpoints

This document will be summarized in your checkpoint 1 presentation.
