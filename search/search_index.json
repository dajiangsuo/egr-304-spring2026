Given our desire for $ V_{o}$=5V, what is the maximum value allowed on $ V_{i}$? Supplying an input voltage that is too high will damage the voltage regulator Within the datasheet, note the dropout voltage in Figure 4. Select the maximum dropout voltage (worst case situation for all current values given). From our desired $ V_{out}$=5V, calculate the minimum input voltage required to drive anything from 20mA to 1.5A. Supplying an input voltage that is too low will prevent the regulator from achieving the desired voltage Look at the datasheet and determine the minimum output current. Find the resistance between output and ground that achieves this minimum current at your selected voltage.You will need to add a resistor between output and ground no greater than this calculated value to achieve the minimum required output current. Some voltage regulators require a little bit of current in order to fully turn on. Without the stated minimum output current, your regulator is not fully operational and the measured output voltages will be wrong. <ol> <li>Review Power Supples 101 to learn what a voltage regulator is, and what types of voltage regulators exist.

Set the voltage to within the allowable range you found previously.</p> <p>The current control feature is helpful to control the amount of current going into a circuit (see page 8 of the manual). Allowing too much current into an incorrect circuit can cause physical damage to PCBs and ICs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Connect the DMM probes to the power supply probes and confirm that the voltage read on the DMM matches the voltage on the power supply display. Note any discrepancies.</p> </li> <li>Turn off the power supply.</li> <li>Now, connect the power supply to your breadboard along the selected power and ground rails.</li> <li> <p>You can now turn the power supply back on.

Adjust the current dial until the over-current indicator turns off.</p> <p>The power supply itself should draw almost no current (less than 20mA).

Be careful, the components will get hot. This reading tells you how well the voltage regulator works under load. Note how this voltage changes when you gently increase the current limit of the power supply.</li> <li>Turn off the power supply.</li> <li>Review pages 62-63 of the DMM manual to learn how to measure DC current. Then, turn the power supply back on and briefly measure the current going through the resistor with the DMM. Be careful, the resistor and/or voltage regulator will get hot. This reading confirms how much current the regulator can supply.</li> <li>Measure the resistance across the two poles used in the potentiometer. This should be done by removing the potentiometer from the circuit before measuring it with the multimeter.  You can then replace it with an equivalent resistance using fixed resistors and re-test.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>In Part 2, you will replace the potentiometer with a fixed resistor, so be sure to write down the value you obtained before the end of class.</p>"},{"location":"304/304-icc-01-supplies-regulators-multimeters/#individual-demonstration-of-proficiency","title":"Individual Demonstration of Proficiency","text":"<p>In class, demonstrate the following live to a member of the teaching team by the end of class:</p> <ol> <li>Your breadboard fully constructed with regulator circuit.</li> <li>DMM measurement of the output voltage of the regulator circuit under no-load conditions.</li> <li>DMM measurement of the output voltage of the regulator circuit under 5.1\u2126 load.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"304/304-icc-01-supplies-regulators-multimeters/#part-2-power-supply-schematic-design","title":"Part 2: Power Supply Schematic Design","text":""},{"location":"304/304-icc-01-supplies-regulators-multimeters/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>In this Part, you will use ECAD design tools to draw your first circuits for EGR304.</p> <p>You must individually demonstrate proficiency in:</p> <ol> <li>Using ECAD (electronic computer-aided drafting) to design circuits.</li> </ol> <p>You may use KiCad\\(^1\\) or Cadence to complete this assignment.

Given the motor rating of 12V, find the coil resistance R using V=IR. Stall current is the current that goes through the motor's windings purely as a function of its internal coil resistance (rather than its motion). Manufacturers often test the stall current by clamping or locking the rotor and measuring the current. Given the driving voltage, this enables them to determine the coil resistance of a motor. note: the DCM-416 Gearmotor's resistance is ~320 Ohm Check the maximum continuous drain current for the AOTF2618L from the datasheet. We need to ensure that we don't damage the transistor when turning on the motor. This transistor happens to be oversized for the necessary current. This is not the limiting factor. Identify the worst-case $ R_{ds(on)}$ of the MOSFET when turned (use Figure 3, and pick the worst case) The $ R_{ds(on)}$ value corresponds to the resistance inside the MOSFET, and helps us understand how much energy will get dumped into heat by it when turned on. Identify the maximum voltage you can set the power supply to. Given the motor's coil resistance R and the MOSFET's maximum continuous current from above, use V=IR again to solve for V Setting the voltage below this limit will limit the current going through the motor when it starts up and prevent damage to the MOSFET. Identify the transistor's maximum Gate-Source Voltage ($ V_{GS} $) The Drain/Source voltage corresponds to the input / logic-level / switching voltage. Going over this value will damage the transistor Identify the transistor's maximum Drain-Source Voltage ($ V_{DS} $) The Drain/Sourceink voltage corresponds to the output / driving voltage of the motor. Going over this value will damage the transistor. Look at Figure 5 (On-Resistance vs.\u00a0Gate-Source Voltage) on page 3 of the AOTF2618L datasheet. Using the worst-case line, what is the resistance of the device at $ V_{GS}$=3.3V? What about at $ V_{GS}$=5V?  CAN YOU USE THIS MOSFET AT 3.3V? MOSFETs also have a nonzero resistance when on. The higher the internal resistance of the transistor, the more it heats up, and the less power that gets delivered to the load. Heat can damage electrical components just as much as electricity. <ol> <li> <p>Assemble the circuit below using your AOTF2618L MOSFET that can supply current through the gear motor.

Identify the maximum voltage you can set the power supply to for this step. Given the motor's coil resistance R found previously and the FAN8100N's maximum continuous current found previously, use V=IR again to solve for V.

What is the syntax for a <code>do-while</code> loop in C, and when is it useful? You will be using a <code>do-while</code> loop to ensure that at least one character is read before jumping out of the loop. See do...while loop in C from tutorialspoint.com. b. What is an ASCII character and how do I reference one in C? ASCII is a way that computers store characters, and you will be reading and converting ASCII characters in this section. Learn more about ASCII conversions at asciitable.com. For example in C, you can represent the letter <code>A</code> as <code>65</code> (decimal integer), <code>0x41</code> (hexadecimal number), or <code>'A'</code> (character with single quotations around it). c. What is the syntax for a <code>switch-case</code> statement in C, and when is it useful? You will be using a <code>switch-case</code> statement to more easily process user input to a multi-option menu. See switch statement from tutorialspoint.com. d. What is an analog to digital converter (ADC)? You will be using an analog to digital converter in this section and in your semester project. Can be found in the Analog to Digital Conversion Tutorial on Sparkfun.com and in section 12.8.5 of Scherz &amp; Monk. e. What is a successive approximation register (SAR) ADC? You will be using a SAR-type ADC built into the PSoC. This article from Maxim Integrated explains how they work. It is recommended that you skim the document. f. What is a hexadecimal number and how do I interpret it? Microcontrollers store data in binary format. Hexadecimal is an easier way to view binary data, and is needed to complete this section. Can be found in the Hexadecimal Tutorial on Sparkfun.com and in Section 12.1.2 of Scherz &amp; Monk. </li> <li> <p>Watch the video PROTOCOLS: UART - I2C - SPI - Serial Communications to learn about UART and RS-232 communications that you will be using in this assignment.

(test with multimeter) Coding Is the code readable/well formatted? (makes debugging easier) Do you know what every line of code does? Does every line of code make sense? (makes understanding behavior easier) Does every line function as it is intended? (avoid unexplainable behavior) Do the variables have datatypes (make like match with like to avoid warnings and errors) Do the loops have entry/break conditions (excluding <code>for;;</code>) (have conscious and complete control of loops) Use read functions as intended: read, check, or save values Use write functions as intended: write values to pins Circuit Do all components function independently (to ensure no broken/dead pieces) Are there any shorts? PSoC Configured pin names match names used in code? Using pins that can provide the intended functionality?

Identify the most often repeated and the most helpful statements from both positive and negative reviews.</p> <p>Suggestion: Try to find common ground when looking through reviews...are users saying the same thing in different ways? Are there any \"expert users\" who give more information about the situation or context they are using the product in? Try to highlight those.</p> </li> <li> <p>Summarize. For each product, list at least three positive statements of the product and three negative statements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Convert each statement to (typically multiple) user needs statements. Identify whether the need you wrote down is \"explicit\" or \"latent\". (see \"Types of User Needs\" posts above or the suggested textbook)</p> <p>Suggestion: See the example in the Appendix.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Organize, consolidate, and group needs statements collected from the above tasks.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Using sticky notes (you will need to photograph your progress) or whiteboard/slide software, create a note for each need statement.</p> <p>Take a picture/screenshot of the notes at this stage</p> </li> <li> <p>Group needs into categories. Combine identical needs by revising the need statement. Give each grouping of needs a unique category, again avoiding an assumption of the technical solution.</p> <p>Next, add a \"meta\" need for each group (highlight or bold to differentiate). For example, you could collect needs about speaker volume, lighting requirements, pinch points, power requirements into a \"safety\" category, with a need statement of \"the product interacts safely with people of all ages.\"</p> <p>Take a picture/screenshot of the notes at this stage</p> </li> <li> <p>Rank needs using your notes and your team's best judgment. This does not have to result in a numbered list, but a way to indicate relative importance (1-3 stars).</p> <p>During a more lengthy design process, this would be a great opportunity to get additional feedback of users' importance with a short survey.

When are office hours?</p> <p>A: See Canvas for up-to-date information on office hours.</p> <p>Q: How many times can I re-spin (re-manufacture) my PCB for this assignment?</p> <p>A: You may only manufacture one PCB design (1 spin) for this assignment. If there are mistakes in the design after it is manufactured, please see your professor or the TAs for help in reworking your PCB to fix them.</p> <p>Additionally, using wires to connect to offboard sensors and actuators is encouraged. We strongly recommend using screw terminals or crimp connectors for this purpose.</p> <p>Q: I was designing a custom padstack for my part and was wondering if my hole size should correspond to a drill size listed on the PCB Mill Specs page. For example I have a part with square pins that are 22.04 x 20.47 mils. Should I make it a circular hole 23.6 mil in diameter because that is what they have a bit for?</p> <p>A: Yes</p> <p>Q: I am trying to connect pins on my PCB using traces. I can select the first pin easily; however, when I try to click the second pin, I get \"DRC error(s) created.\" in the command line. The only design rules errors I received when netlisting my schematic was that some of the pins (VDDA, VDDR, and XRES on the PSoC specifically) were unconnected, and this error message pops up when I try to connect built-in components as well. Because of this, I can't make any traces on my board. How do I fix this?</p> <p>A: In the PCB editor, do the two pins that you are trying to connect have a thin blue line between them? If these lines are not showing up, it could indicate that the pins are not connected on the schematic. If this is the case, the PCB editor will not allow you to add a trace between the pins.</p> <p></p> <p>Is there anything close to where you are trying to run the trace that might be causing a clearance issue (other pins, ground plane, etc)? This will also prevent the PCB editor from adding a trace.</p> <p></p> <p>Q: I'm trying to create my PCB layout, but when I go to select a part I want to place on the board, it appears in the preview box but once selected, nothing shows up on the cursor for me to place. Any suggestions as to what I can do?</p> <p>A: Check the location of the origin in the symbol file (.dra) for the part you are trying to place. If it is not near the symbol, the symbol will appear offset from the cursor and sometimes will be off of the screen.</p> <p>Symbol file:</p> <p></p> <p>When placing this symbol:</p> <p></p> <p>To fix this, you can move the drawing origin using the option in the setup menu. You can either click near the component to set the new origin, or place it at a precise location by typing coordinates in the command line (e.g.\u00a0\"x 500 500\").</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>For more information on using the command line to enter coordinates, see: https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/placing-and-moving-components-in-cadence-pcb-editor/</p> <p>Q: I keep getting this error: \"Net has fewer than two connections N00437\"</p> <p>A: A \"net\" in cadence refers to a connection (I.e. a wire or trace). The \"fewer than two connections\" error is most common when a pin is labeled with a net alias but the net alias is not used elsewhere. Try going to edit&gt;browse&gt;nets and click on the one named N00437 to show it on your schematic. This might help pinpoint the source of the error.</p> <p>Examples would be the three connections shown below:</p> <p></p> <p>To fix this, either remove the netlist symbol or add a matching symbol in the correct location. For example, the circuit above could be fixed by removing net1 and adding a battery connector component with GND and 5V symbols:</p> <p></p> <p>Q: I am having trouble with path errors even after having correctly set up the config.ini file and the PCB editor settings. Do any of the other TAs have a solution to this? This sounds like it might be similar to a problem you helped someone with earlier in the week?</p> <p>A: I found a couple of posts from last year's forum that could be related. Also see the instructors' answer below.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>And...</p> <p></p> <p>In addition to the instructions on the ESD blog, I also found it useful to bring all my custom paths to the top of the search order in PCB Editor. This seemed to have a positive impact for me.</p> <p>Make sure you do not have spaces in any of the pathnames that you enter.</p> <p>Q: I am trying to remake my footprint for my microcontroller and when I try to put in \"x 100 -900\" i keep receiving this error \"Pick is outside the extent of the drawing ... pick again.\". What can I do to fix this error?</p> <p>A: You can fix this error by going into Setup&gt; Design Parameters, and choosing the minimum x and y distances to be -10000. The reason why you are getting this error is because the default minimums are set to 0 for both x and y, thus -900 is not defined. See below:</p> <p></p> <p>Q: My board got rejected due to via size issues. What should I do?</p> <p>A: The default via pad in cadence is too small to be manufactured on our mill. Please see the following tutorial on how to fix this problem to avoid DFM errors or rejected PCB's. Increasing the size also makes the vias easier to work with during debugging and testing.</p> <p>Q: When I try and route a trace through a VIA (double click) it will not switch to the backside of the PCB. I noticed on the left in the options it shows 'Top', 'Bottom', and 'No available via'. Any idea why I cant add vias?</p> <p>A: Inside Allegro PCB Designer,</p> <ol> <li> <p>Setup -&gt; Constraints -&gt; Constraint Manager</p> </li> <li> <p>'Physical' tab</p> </li> <li> <p>Net -&gt; 'All Layers'</p> </li> <li> <p>Select 8th column (Vias)</p> </li> <li> <p>Double click each cell and select your favorite VIA</p> </li> <li> <p>Close -&gt; Enjoy</p> </li> </ol> <p>Q: PCB Editor will not open and it keeps complaining about a license server problem</p> <p>A: If the PCB editor will not open due to a licensing error, make sure that you have the AnyConnect VPN running. Instructions for installing this can be found here: https://myapps.asu.edu/app/cisco-ssl-vpn-pc-46x. This applies whether you are on campus or off campus.</p> <p>Q: I get \"ERROR: Property \"PCB Footprint\" missing from instance --\"</p> <p>A: You need to 1) ensure that each schematic symbol has an associated footprint (double click the schematic item and ensure that the footprint entry is not blank; and 2) ensure that your paths have been set up correctly to find those footprints (see blog entry on cadence configuration).</p> <p>\\(^1\\) Exceptions allowed with prior approval from your professor</p> <p>\\(^2\\) KiCad is only permitted in EGR304</p>"},{"location":"304/project-description/","title":"EGR304 Fall 2023 Project Description","text":""},{"location":"304/project-description/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>A number of trends have emerged in bicycling over the past decade.

Additionally, Peralta 103 and 109 are a non-lead solder work area due to the number of soldering stations that can possibly be in use at different points in time, so you are asked to refrain from bringing any lead percentage version of solder into these areas.</p>"},{"location":"304/syllabus/syllabus-print/#computer-and-network-recommendations","title":"Computer and Network Recommendations","text":"<ul> <li>For KiCad:<ul> <li>PC or Mac with at least 5 GB free hard drive space, 8Gb RAM, Intel i5 or better.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For Cadence:<ul> <li>PC or Mac (via Boot Camp/Parallels/etc.) with at least 25 GB free hard drive space, running Windows 10 (64-bit) Professional (not Starter or Home Basic) or higher</li> <li>Recommended: Intel CoreTM i7 4.30 GHz or AMD Ryzen 7 4.30 GHz with at least 4 cores, 16 GB RAM, 50 GB free disk space, 1920 x 1200 display resolution.

When are your office hours? A: See Canvas for up-to-date information on office hours.</p> <p>Q: It is difficult to create a schematic without crossing wires. Is it OK if wires cross as long as they do not connect? A: Wires can cross in a schematic, but there are best practices for making schematics look professional. See the Keeping a Schematic Tidy blog entry and/or stop by office hours.</p> <p>Q: If my subsystem is connecting to another team member's subsystem via one or more pins, should I leave those pins empty? A: At this point, it is best to connect the necessary pin(s) to header pins so that you have a way to physically interface subsystems during future testing.</p> <p>Q: How do you increase the size of the toolbar in Cadence? A: Experiment with the compatibility settings in Windows. Right click on Orcad Capture Lite, select \"Open file location\". The program directory will pop up. Right click on the icon for Orcad Capture light, and select \"properties\"(1). Go to the compatibility tab and select \"DPI settings\"(2). Try playing with settings (3) and (4).</p> <p>Q: When pulling up libraries when first starting to create a custom schematic symbol, custom library is not coming up as an option. How do I get my custom library to come up? A: You can create a custom library folder by choosing \"File &gt; New &gt; Library\". This will create a new library with a default name under Design Resources in the project.</p> <p></p> <p>Once you have the custom library created, right-click on the library and choose \"New Part\".</p> <p>Q: I get this error, how do I fix it?</p> <p>Duplicate Pin Name \"DRAIN\" found on Package IRF520 , Q1 Pin Number 4: SCHEMATIC1, PAGE1 (4.90, 2.30). Please renumber one of these.</p> <p>A: Select the part, then right click on it and select \"Edit Part\". If you double click on each of the top two pins, you will see that they both have the name set to \"DRAIN\". Change the names so that they do not match. For example, \"DRAIN1\" and \"DRAIN2\":</p> <p>Close the part editor tab and when it asks if you want to update the part, select \"Update All\" then \"Yes\". Save the file and try netlisting again.</p> <p>Q: I need help! When are your office hours? A: See Canvas for up-to-date information on office hours.</p> <p>Q: How many times can I re-spin (re-manufacture) my PCB for this assignment? A: You may only manufacture your PCB design one time (1 spin) for this assignment. If there are mistakes in the design after it is manufactured, please see your professor or the TAs for help in reworking your PCB to fix them.</p> <p>Q: I was designing a custom padstack for my part and was wondering if my hole size should correspond to a drill size listed on the PCB Mill Specs page. For example I have a part with square pins that are 22.04 x 20.47 mils. Should I make it a circular hole 23.6 mil in diameter because that is what they have a bit for? A: Yes please! This will make your board faster to manufacture and reduce wear on the tools in Peralta Lab.</p> <p>Q: I am trying to connect pins on my PCB using traces. I can select the first pin easily; however, when I try to click the second pin, I get \"DRC error(s) created.\" in the command line. The only design rules errors I received when netlisting my schematic was that some of the pins (VDDA, VDDR, and XRES on the PSoC specifically) were unconnected, and this error message pops up when I try to connect built-in components as well. Because of this, I can't make any traces on my board. How do I fix this? A: In the PCB editor, do the two pins that you are trying to connect have a thin blue line between them? If these lines are not showing up, it could indicate that the pins are not connected on the schematic. If this is the case, the PCB editor will not allow you to add a trace between the pins.</p> <p></p> <p>Is there anything close to where you are trying to run the trace that might be causing a clearance issue (other pins, ground plane, etc)? This will also prevent the PCB editor from adding a trace.</p> <p></p> <p>Q: I'm trying to create my PCB layout, but when I go to select a part I want to place on the board, it appears in the preview box but once selected, nothing shows up on the cursor for me to place. Any suggestions as to what I can do? A: Check the location of the origin in the symbol file (.dra) for the part you are trying to place. If it is not near the symbol, the symbol will appear offset from the cursor and sometimes will be off of the screen.</p> <p>Symbol file:</p> <p></p> <p>When placing this symbol:</p> <p></p> <p>To fix this, you can move the drawing origin using the option in the setup menu. You can either click near the component to set the new origin, or place it at a precise location by typing coordinates in the command line (e.g.\u00a0\"x 500 500\").</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>For more information on using the command line to enter coordinates, see: https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/placing-and-moving-components-in-cadence-pcb-editor/</p> <p>Q: I keep getting this error: \"Net has fewer than two connections N00437\" A: A \"net\" in Cadencerefers to a connection (I.e. a wire or trace). The \"fewer than two connections\" error is most common when a pin is labeled with a net alias but the net alias is not used elsewhere. Try going to edit&gt;browse&gt;nets and click on the one named N00437 to show it on your schematic. This might help pinpoint the source of the error.</p> <p>Examples would be the three connections shown below:</p> <p></p> <p>To fix this, either remove the netlist symbol or add a matching symbol in the correct location. For example, the circuit above could be fixed by removing net1 and adding a battery connector component with GND and 5V symbols:</p> <p></p> <p>Q: I am having trouble with path errors even after having correctly set up the config.ini file and the PCB editor settings. Do any of the other TAs have a solution to this? This sounds like it might be similar to a problem you helped someone with earlier in the week? A: I found a couple of posts from last year's forum that could be related. Also see the instructors' answer below.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>And...</p> <p></p> <p>In addition to the instructions on the ESD blog, I also found it useful to bring all my custom paths to the top of the search order in pcb editor. This seemed to have a positive impact for me.</p> <p>Make sure you do not have spaces in any of the pathnames that you enter.</p> <p>Q: I am trying to remake my footprint for PSoC and when I try to put in \"x 100 -900\" i keep receiving this error \"Pick is outside the extent of the drawing ... pick again.\". What can I do to fix this error? A: You can fix this error by going into Setup&gt; Design Parameters, and choosing the minimum x and y distances to be -10000. The reason why you are getting this error is because the default minimums are set to 0 for both x and y, thus -900 is not defined. See below:</p> <p></p> <p>Q: My board got rejected due to via size issues. What should I do? A: The default via pad in Cadence is too small to be manufactured on our mill. Please see the following tutorial on how to fix this problem to avoid DFM errors or rejected PCB's. Increasing the size also makes the vias easier to work with during debugging and testing.</p> <p>Q: When I try and route a trace through a VIA (double click) it will not switch to the backside of the PCB. I noticed on the left in the options it shows 'Top', 'Bottom', and 'No available via'. Any idea why I cant add vias?

May I re-spin (re-manufacture) it?</p> <p>A: Generally, no. Most mistakes can be fixed by cutting traces and soldering wires onto your existing board. Please see the professors or TAs for help in reworking your PCB. Also, it is recommended that you still fix your design in Cadence so that it is ready for the Full PCB assignment later in the semester.</p> <p>Q: Do we have to fabricate separate PCBs for each team member? Or could we submit a single PCB since they will be located in the exact same place and be connected together (with other team members schematics/blocks) anyways?</p> <p>A: Each team member needs to submit their own subsystem on a separate PCB. This is to ensure that every student has this skill (a learning outcome of the course). Breaking the board into subsystems also assists in the debugging process. You will combine your debugged subsystems into one final board for your team project.</p> <p>Q: Is it possible to submit a video demonstration of our subsystem to canvas?</p> <p>A: No. We require live (non-video) demonstrations in order to confirm your proficiency with the entire process.</p> <p>Q: As I was testing and putting the board together I found that somewhere, the voltage input was in contact with ground. I have made several big manual fixes to the board including drilling out a hole to make room for a connector. But just from what I can actually see, there are no solder bridges there. How do I fix this?</p> <p>A: Unfortunately PCBs are tough to debug without seeing live (or virtually). I highly recommend taking advantage of office hours. Having said that, places where you've manually modified the board after manufacturing are a common place where continuity problems occur. Using the continuity tester isn't helpful for locating shorts, so I'd recommend using the ohmmeter and look for a spot with lower resistance to get an idea of where the issue might be.</p> <p>Q: Will taking a knife and manually isolating the pads work to fix continuity problems?</p> <p>A: Yes, you can use an exacto knife to isolate the pads, but I would only do that once you've eliminated other possibilities. A TA should be able to help more in office hours.</p> <p>Q: I have soldered all my components and am now having a continuity problem. Now what?</p> <p>A: The best way to eliminate continuity problems is to test your before you have soldered on components, and then to test continuity after adding each component so you can trace the problem to your most recent action. Otherwise you will have to methodically desolder components from the board until the short goes away.</p> <p>Also, sometimes incorrect footprints will cause shorts through the microcontroller. To protect your microcontroller and PCB, attach your microcontroller without power and check for shorts between power and ground. Only then should you power up the board.</p>"},{"location":"3x4/3x4-team-block-diagram/","title":"Block Diagram","text":"<p>Team Assignment</p> EGR 304 EGR 314 304 Block Diagram Example with PSoC &amp; Bluetooth 314 Block Diagram Example with PIC, ESP32, and MQTT"},{"location":"3x4/3x4-team-block-diagram/#objectives","title":"Objectives","text":"<p>To define the overall hardware architecture for your team's project, and capture each team member's subsystem in a single combined block diagram, then convert that to a table which will eventually be used for verifying system functionality.</p>"},{"location":"3x4/3x4-team-block-diagram/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Drawing Software on the Embedded Systems Design blog</li> <li>304 Example block diagram (draw.io template)(full size image)</li> <li>314 Example block diagram (draw.io template)(full size image)<ul> <li>draw.io getting started</li> </ul> </li> <li>Course Documents<ul> <li>EGR 304/314 Course Sequence Requirements</li> <li>304 Project Description</li> <li>314 Project Description</li> <li>Verification Table Example and Template</li> </ul> </li> <li>Canvas discussion board</li> </ul> <p>We highly recommended that you closely follow the Example block diagram on the first page and review the Most Common Mistakes section below before completing the assignment.</p>"},{"location":"3x4/3x4-team-block-diagram/#part-1-block-diagram","title":"Part 1: Block Diagram","text":"<p>Bring to class on the date noted on the calendar in Canvas for an in-class feedback activity.

Your rationale should be strong (e.g., avoid rationale such as \"we chose this part because it's the first one on Google that met our specifications\"). See example in Table 1 below.</p> <p>Also, label in bold which component selections are associated with individual subsystems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Power budget (optional for initial submission, required for checkpoint 2 presentation and report).

If a motor driver can drive a 1A motor, the driver itself does not consume 1A of current from the power supply - the motor itself consumes 1A.</p> </li> <li> <p>In Section B, assign each major component to ONE power rail. Try to minimize the number of power rails in a system to 1 or 2 (e.g., 5V for logic and 12V for electromechanical actuators). Add a 25% safety margin onto the current needed to operate the system.</p> </li> <li>In Section C, for each power rail, select a specific voltage regulator if you are not using a regulated power supply. If you are using a regulated power supply, then list it instead of the regulator. Modify your Major Component Selection document from Part 3 above to create a selection table for each voltage regulator, describing at least 2 potential solutions for each in the design and describing multiple pros and cons of each solution. Choose a final solution for both the power source and the regulator, and describe the rationale for the choices (see example, Table 1). Then, enter the final selection for each rail next to \"Regulator or Source Choice\" in the power budget.</li> <li>In Section D, select a specific external power source. Typically a wall supply or battery, confirm that it can supply all of the regulators for all of the power rails simultaneously. If you need multiple power sources, list each separately and indicate which regulators will be connected to each supply. Confirm that the Total Remaining Current Available on each external power source is not negative.</li> <li>In Section E, calculate battery life. If your design uses a battery, calculate the worst-case life of the battery (assuming all subsystems are running simultaneously) in hours.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Source Parts: You will be building 2 - 3 iterations of your design: individual subsystem boards and a final team board. Therefore, you need to order at least 2 sets of parts to build all of the circuits in your design, plus extras in case parts get damaged during prototyping.

Who should be responsible for the power supply?</p> <p>A: The power supply does not count as a subsystem, but should be included in the responsibilities of the person who is working on the microcontroller subsystem.</p> <p>Power Budget</p> <p>Q: If I have two separate parts to my system that are powered separately (e.g., a main PCB and a remote sensor, both with their own microcontrollers and/or wireless boards), should I put them on one power budget or two?</p> <p>A: They should be on two separate power budgets since they are two separately powered systems in physically different locations.</p> <p>Top Design (EGR 304 only)</p> <p>Q: How do we add BLE to our Top Design?</p> <p>A: The Bluetooth functionality is in its own EZ-BLE module on the PSoC board, and is connected to the PSoC via UART (see Figure 3-5 in the Prototyping Kit Guide). Therefore, your Top Design should have a UART component connected to the ports shown in Figure 3-5 that allow it to connect with the EZ-BLE module.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Avoid the word \"cheap\". \"Cheap\" means poor quality, while \"inexpensive\" means affordable.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"3x4/3x4-team-design-ideation/","title":"Design Ideation","text":"<p>Team Assignment</p>"},{"location":"3x4/3x4-team-design-ideation/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The objective of this assignment is to ideate design features of your product and to provide the client with alternating visions of your project.</p>"},{"location":"3x4/3x4-team-design-ideation/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Embedded Systems Design Resources website<ul> <li>Drawing Software</li> </ul> </li> <li>Ideation - General<ul> <li>https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ideation</li> <li>https://www.justinmind.com/blog/8-ux-ideation-techniques-to-try-out/</li> </ul> </li> <li>How to Ideate / Effective Ideation<ul> <li>https://uxplanet.org/whats-the-deal-with-ideation-e02324e95c8</li> <li>https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ideation-in-practice/</li> </ul> </li> <li>Brainstorm techniques<ul> <li>https://lucidspark.com/blog/4-group-brainstorming-techniques</li> <li>https://formlabs.com/blog/brainstorming-product-ideas/</li> <li>https://www.figma.com/blog/the-five-stages-of-an-effective-brainstorm/</li> </ul> </li> <li>Mockups<ul> <li>https://uxdesign.cc/how-google-approaches-the-process-of-ideation-f2fc00091f32</li> <li>DALL-E 2 or other AI image generation tools - may be used to help generate design mockups.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Canvas discussion board</li> <li>EGR 304/314 Course Sequence Requirements</li> <li>Project Description (304 | 314)</li> <li>Web Resources<ul> <li>What is a Vector Image?</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>-</p>"},{"location":"3x4/3x4-team-design-ideation/#assignment","title":"Assignment","text":""},{"location":"3x4/3x4-team-design-ideation/#1-generate-ideas","title":"1.

Make sure to clearly label each diagram and annotate it with an explanation of why there are multiple diagrams for the same project.</p> <p>Q: How is this different from a user story or user experience diagram? A: While this is supposed to capture user interactions with the system, the diagram is from the perspective of the microprocessor. Thus, user inputs may drive the behavior of the system, but the diagram should capture what the software will do in response to the various possible inputs from the user at any given state or stage of the flow.</p> <p>Q: Should my program end after the product has been used once? A: Typically, no. Most products will have a loop from near the end of the software design back to somewhere near the beginning so that the product can be used continuously.</p> <p>Q: If I have two microcontrollers in my design, do I need a separate diagram for each one?
