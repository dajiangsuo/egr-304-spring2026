Put abbreviations next to hours in the week you ***are certain*** will be generally free ***throughout** the semester*. Consider your other hard constraints in a typical week, such as other classes, work, transit, meals, or family commitments.

-   Identify at least ***four*** hours shared by the entire team ***outside of class time.***

-   If you find sufficient overlap, create a team in Canvas by going to the "People" tab and selecting an available team number. The 100# teams are for the morning section, and the 200# teams are for the afternoon section. You are limited to **four** members maximum.

## Submission

-   Each team must submit its completed schedule to Canvas in order to receive approval to form. Submit your completed team schedule in PDF format on Canvas by the deadline stated in the calendar. *Do not submit links to online documents.* It is your responsibility to ensure that the submission was successful.
