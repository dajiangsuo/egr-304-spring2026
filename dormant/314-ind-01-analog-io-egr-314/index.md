## Resources

* [Analog IO over EUSART tutorial](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/analog-io-eusart/) on the Embedded Systems website
* Canvas Discussion Board

## Prior to Demonstration of Proficiency

Complete the [analog IO over EUSART tutorial](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/analog-io-eusart/) on the Embedded Systems website.

# Individual Demonstration of Proficiency

*You must complete the demonstration individually, either in office hours or in class if time permits.*

1. Walk a member of the teaching team through your workspace and code
1. Connect your Curiosity Nano to a computer via USB. Open your MPLabX project. Generate MCC. Compile the program, and program your board.
1. Demonstrate the ability to read an analog value and output it over EUSART.
1. Demonstrate control over the *duty cycle* of your PWM-driven LED running at a 131.072ms timer period based on the potentiometer's input.

# Canvas Submission

Submit your packaged MPLabX projects (right-click on the project and select "Package" from the contextual menu) for each section in ZIP format to this assignment on [Canvas](https://canvas.asu.edu) by the deadline in Canvas. *Do not submit links to Google documents.* It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission to Canvas was successful. Late Canvas submissions will be graded per the policy in the syllabus. No credit will be awarded for assignments not submitted to Canvas, even if a demonstration was completed.

# Grading

| **Demonstration**                               | **Points** |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| MPLabX Workspace (submitted on Canvas)          | 50         |
| Step 1: Connect, compile, generate, and program | 50         |
| Step 2: Read Analog to EUSART                   | 100        |
| Step 3: Read Analog to PWM Duty Cycle           | 100        |
| **Total**                                       | **300**    |
