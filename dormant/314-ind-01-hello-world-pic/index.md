***Individual Assignment***

## Objectives

To individually demonstrate proficiency in installing and running the Microchip MPLabX Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and programming a Microchip [PIC16F18446 Curiosity Nano](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM164144). **This is an individual homework assignment** but you may work with others to determine how to complete the assignment.

## Prior to Demonstration of Proficiency

*Complete all of the steps below prior to the demonstration of proficiency.*

*Note*: You must use the Microchip [PIC16F18446 Curiosity Nano](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM164144) to complete this assignment. You will be using a different microcontroller for your team project.

1.  Watch the [Rapid Prototyping with the PIC/AVR Curiosity Nano Board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKPuql2Jp5I), [Curiosity Nano Unboxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHfmKVveJdU), and [PIC16F18446 Family of Microcontrollers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4gO2tZ7ek0) videos from Microchip for a brief introduction to the platform.

2.  Download and install the [MPLabX IDE](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide) (available for both Windows and Mac)

3.  Download and install the [MPLabXC8 Compiler v2.10](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers) (available for both Windows and Mac)

4.  [Install MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC)](https://microchipdeveloper.com/install:mcc)

5.  Open MPLabX IDE and plug the Curiosity Nano board into the USB port of your computer

6.  Follow steps 1, 2, and 3 in the [Curiosity Nano Tutorial](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/curiosity-nano-mplab-tutorial-and-lab/) to create your first project in MPLabX and become familiar with Microchip Code Configurator (MCC)

7.  Follow the instructions in section 4.1 of the [Curiosity Nano Tutorial](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/curiosity-nano-mplab-tutorial-and-lab/) to make an onboard LED blink. This will be the first demonstration of proficiency.

8.  Follow the instructions in section 4.2 of the [Curiosity Nano Tutorial](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/curiosity-nano-mplab-tutorial-and-lab/) to make two external LEDs blink. Modify the circuit and code to make (4) LEDs light up in the following sequence with a 1 second delay between each change: LED 1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4. This will be the second demonstration of proficiency.

9.  Follow the instructions in section 4.3 of the [Curiosity Nano Tutorial](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/curiosity-nano-mplab-tutorial-and-lab/) to make a single LED "breathe" using PWM. Modify the code to make the LED onboard the Curiosity "breathe" instead of an external LED. This will be the third demonstration of proficiency.

10. Follow the instructions in section 4.4 of the [Curiosity Nano Tutorial](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/curiosity-nano-mplab-tutorial-and-lab/) to make a single external LED "breathe" using PWM when the button on the Curiosity board is pressed, and to turn off when the button is not pressed. Modify the circuit and code to use an external switch (or jumper wire) to trigger the external LED instead of the onboard button. This will be the fourth demonstration of proficiency.

## Demonstration of Proficiency

*You must complete the demonstration individually, either in office hours or in class if time permits.*

1.  Connect a [PIC16F18446 Curiosity Nano](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM164144) to a computer via USB

2.  Demonstrate a single onboard LED blinking (section 4.1 of the [Curiosity Nano Tutorial](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/curiosity-nano-mplab-tutorial-and-lab/))

3.  Demonstrate (4) LEDs lighting up in the following sequence with a 1 second delay between each change: LED 1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4 (based on section 4.2 of the [Curiosity Nano Tutorial](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/curiosity-nano-mplab-tutorial-and-lab/))

4.  Demonstrate the LED onboard the Curiosity "breathing" using PWM (based on section 4.3 of the [Curiosity Nano Tutorial](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/curiosity-nano-mplab-tutorial-and-lab/))

5.  Demonstrate an external LED "breathing" using PWM only when an external switch is pressed (based on section 4.4 of the [Curiosity Nano Tutorial](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/curiosity-nano-mplab-tutorial-and-lab/))

## Submission

No Canvas submission is necessary. Complete your demonstrations by the deadline in the course calendar on [Canvas](https://canvas.asu.edu). Late demonstrations will be graded per the policy in the syllabus.
