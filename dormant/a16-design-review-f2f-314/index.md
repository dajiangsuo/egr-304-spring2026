***Team Assignment***

## Objectives

A *design review* is a common industry process by which a design is critiqued by colleagues with the intent of discovering errors and suggestions of improvements prior to implementation.

In this activity, your team will both (1) present and discuss your design and (2) provide feedback on others' designs by asking questions and completing a detailed evaluation checklist.

Design Review presentations will be in person in Cooley Ballroom C in the Poly Student Union on Monday and Wednesday of Design Review week. The Design Review will be graded based on the *Design Review Action Items and Document Submission* assignment on canvas

## Format

Design reviews will span over two days of class. On each day, half of the teams in the class will present their designs simultaneously for feedback at tables around the room (2) times for 30 minutes each to two different groups of students, faculty, and/or industry professionals. The other half of the teams will review the teams that are presenting.

Design reviews will be **in-person in Cooley Ballroom C in the Poly Student Union.** Attendance will be taken on both design review days.

**Dress is business casual on both days of design reviews.**

Presentations will consist of talking reviewers through printed copies of the design documents discussed below. Reviewers can ask questions both during and after your presentation. **Do NOT create a PowerPoint presentation.**

## During the Design Review

### Presenting Teams

Designate a notetaker for your group, and take notes on the questions and feedback provided orally by reviewers. Your notes should include feedback on the overall concept ("overall"), the look and feel of your project ("form"), the technical design itself (e.g., part selection, errors, omissions, problem areas) ("design"), and who gave you each piece of feedback. **Your notes for each of the two reviews and derived action items must be submitted to Canvas and will be part of your grade.** Allow time for reviewers to ask questions throughout. Present your designs in the following order:

**Technical Review**

1.  Abridged *Design Concept*

    1.  Visually-engaging representation of what your team's design is

    2.  Visual story-based representation of how your team's design will be used by a user

2.  Abridged *Problem Definition*

    1. Updated problem statement

    1. Updated specifications with completed "Actual Value" and "Evidence and Discussion" columns

    1. *Do NOT include benchmarking information*

3.  Updated *Block Diagram*

4.  Final selections and rationale from your *Major Component Selection Rationale* and ***(EGR 314 only)*** *Microcontroller Selection Rationale*

    1. *Do NOT include components that were not selected for use*

5.  Full project schematic(s) (from *Hardware Design*)

6.  ***(EGR 304 only)*** [PSoC Creator Top Design](#)

7.  ***(EGR 314 only)*** Network diagram and sequence diagram (from *Protocol Design and Implementation Plan*)

8.  Activity diagram(s) or state diagram(s) (from *Software Design*)

**Remember to allow time for reviewers to ask questions throughout**

### Reviewing Teams

Each team will provide feedback on two (2) other teams' designs by:

1.  Completing a detailed electronic evaluation rubric. **Please bring or borrow a device that you can complete a review form with.** The quality of your reviews will be graded. The following 4 rubrics should be completed by the reviewing team (one per team member):

    1. [Student Reviewer 1 Form](https://forms.gle/EQ1rVvnmirWk1c7Y6)

    1. [Student Reviewer 2 Form](https://forms.gle/LsM4fbxh9ZsSe4nZ9)

    1. [Student Reviewer 3 Form](https://forms.gle/wL85hDHZfSk8RCMy8)

    1. [Student Reviewer 4 Form](https://forms.gle/wpUBVP9Tt1KANseb6)

2.  Providing a critical review of other teams' designs by asking questions and suggesting improvements.


## After the Design Review

1.  Based on the notes taken during the design review, construct a table of numbered action items. Action items should start with a verb (e.g., "clarify power stage of piezoelectric subsystem with transistor part number and pinouts"). Categorize each item of feedback as (1) "overall", (2) "form" (look and feel), or (3) "design" along with who gave you each piece of feedback. Also include a column indicating the status of addressing each of the comments. Ensure that you have **at least** 5 overall comments, 5 comments on the form, and 10 comments on the design.

> *Table 1: Example Action Items*

|     | **Action Item** | **Category** | **Reviewer** | **Status** |
|-----|:----------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-----------|
| 1   |                 |              |              |            |
| 2   |                 |              |              |            |
| 3   |                 |              |              |            |
| ... |                 |              |              |            |

2.  Modify your original design documents to correct as many of the errors identified as you can prior to submitting your final design review documents. Update the action items table with the status of addressing each issue. While it is not required that you address all of the issues prior to submission, your product (and grade) will be higher if you are able to address all of them.

## Canvas Submission

**You may correct errors in your design identified during the design review prior to submission on Canvas.** Then, submit the following to Canvas by the deadline in the course calendar on Canvas:

1.  Single PDF of the entire **Team Binder** (not the Reviewer Packet). **You may correct errors in your design identified during the design review prior to submission.
    > 
    > *Ensure your diagrams are legible*.** Rasterized (pixelated) images will receive a 0 if they are illegible. Utilize printing to PDF or saving to a vector file (.svg for example) to ensure the quality of your submission remains intact. No screenshots.

2.  Notes taken during each of the design reviews **and** action items table in Office or PDF format.

***Your diagrams must be legible in order to be graded*.** Rasterized (pixelated) images will receive a 0 if they are illegible. *Do not submit links to Google documents.* It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission to Canvas was successful. Late Canvas submissions will be graded per the policy in the syllabus. No credit will be awarded for assignments not submitted to Canvas.

## Grading

As described above in the assignment description. Attendance is *required* on both days in order to receive credit for the design review.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** Do internal reviewers (students in our class) affect presenters' grades?

**A:** No. Internal reviewers are providing feedback for two purposes: (1) to help other teams improve their designs, and (2) to get experience providing professional feedback on others' designs. Internal reviewers will be graded on the quality/depth of their reviews of other teams' designs, but their feedback will **not** impact other teams' grades.

Feedback from **external** (not students in the class) reviewers **does** impact the grades of presenting teams.
