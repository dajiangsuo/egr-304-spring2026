title: User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements
---

***Team Assignment***

## Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to collect user needs based on related products on the market and distill those needs into a weighted set of design objectives and product requirements

Product requirements documents are one way to develop, rationalize, and specify in engineering terms requirements of your product. Developing product requirements comes after the User Needs Identification steps, where an engineering team converts what they heard from the user into a set of engineering requirements that follow the SMART rule: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.

This assignment asks you to read more on product requirements documents and for your team to create its own. Pay special attention to the references to decision matrices, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), and other tools with more information linked below.

## Instructions

1. **Voice of the Customer Benchmarking**

    Your team must benchmark a *minimum* of 5 existing commercial products related to the product you are developing. Consider products that may solve the entire problem that your team has identified (e.g., a direct competitor), as well as products that may not solve the entire problem but have some interesting features that you could use in your design (e.g., the Internet connection capability of a vending machine). In addition to commercial solutions, your benchmarks should include patents (see Resources above).

    1. *Review* the voice of the customer article linked above or the suggested textbook.

    2. *Conduct* a search with Google, on Amazon, or elsewhere. Keywords are important -- the right keywords will help you find related products. The wrong keywords may put you on the wrong course.

        *Record* each search conducted. Include the keywords used and a link to the results page.

    3. *Identify* the top five related products that have sufficient reviews to collect data with. This can be the result of multiple searches with variations of keywords used.

    4. For each product, *read* through the 4-5-star ratings and the 1-2-star ratings. Identify the *most often repeated* and the *most helpful* statements from both positive and negative reviews.

        > *Suggestion:* Try to find common ground when looking through reviews...are users saying the same thing in different ways? Are there any "expert users" who give more information about the situation or context they are using the product in? Try to highlight those.

    5. Summarize. For each product, list at least **three** positive statements of the product and **three** negative statements.

    6. Convert each statement to (typically multiple) user needs statements. Identify whether the need you wrote down is "explicit" or "latent". (see "Types of User Needs" posts above or the suggested textbook)

        > ***Suggestion:** See the example in the [appendix](#appendix-voc-benchmarking-example).*

    7. You should have approximately sixty **(60)** user needs.  The more the better.  Typical user needs generation process from industry can go into the hundreds.

1. **Organize**, consolidate, and group needs statements collected from the above tasks.

    1. Using sticky notes (you will need to photograph your progress) or whiteboard/slide software, create **one note for each need statement**.

        > ***Take a picture/screenshot of the notes at this stage***

    1. Group needs into categories. Combine identical needs by revising the need statement. Give each grouping of needs a unique category, *again avoiding an assumption of the technical solution*.

        Next, add a "meta" need for each group (highlight or bold to differentiate). For example, you could collect needs about speaker volume, lighting requirements, pinch points, power requirements into a "safety" category, with a need statement of "the product interacts safely with people of all ages."

        > ***Take a picture/screenshot of the notes at this stage***

    1. **Rank** needs using your notes and your team's best judgment. This does not have to result in a numbered list, but a way to indicate relative importance (1-3 stars).

        > *During a more lengthy design process, this would be a great opportunity to get additional feedback of users' importance with a short survey. See "Quantifying User Needs" resources above, or the suggested textbook*

        > ***Take a picture/screenshot of the notes at this stage***

        Ensure you have documented the evolution of this process from beginning to end. Take a picture/screenshot of the notes

        - when all the notes have been  added
        - after grouping
        - after ranking

    1. **Compile** your sticky notes and VOC benchmarking into an ordered list of user needs, with meta-needs and ranking.

        > You should have sorted and prioritized at least 100 user needs

1. ***Develop Requirements***
    2. Read through this [article](https://formlabs.com/blog/product-requirements-document-prd-with-template/) on Product Requirements Documents.

    2. Create a copy of the template provided, and develop your own product requirements document

    3. Include all sections provided by the template up to but not including the Appendices

        1. Include at least two use cases, from the perspectives of how users interact with the product in either 1) two particular types of venues, 2) two different interaction examples, or 3) two different stakeholders that interact with the product (e.g. museum docent and visitor).

        1. Include the following design aspects:

            - Hardware / Product Design
            - Software / Functionality
            - Interactivity & User Experience
            - Customization
            - Manufacturing
            - Safety (Feel free to include any safety regulations you come across in your research)

## Submission Instructions

This work will be used in multiple ways. It will be reviewed for feedback in class on the date given in Canvas, so please be prepared to discuss it with a member of the teaching team.

### Canvas Submission

Submit the document in PDF format on [Canvas](https://canvas.asu.edu) by the deadline given for your section. *Do not submit links to Google documents.* It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission to Canvas was successful. Late Canvas submissions will be graded per the policy in the syllabus. No credit will be awarded for assignments not submitted to Canvas.

## Subsequent Uses of this document

### Classtime

This document should be made available during classtime for review by the teaching team on the due date. We will provide feedback, which will be your responsibility to integrate and address in subsequent submissions.

### Report

This document will also be added to your team's report and maintained throughout the semester. It will be graded for additional feedback in upcoming project checkpoints.

## Grading

As described above in Assignment description

| **Item**                               | **Points** |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Full (complete) draft submitted to Canvas and brought to class | 50         |

## Most Common Mistakes

1. Writing performance specifications that are not measurable. If a criterion is not measurable (e.g., "soft") how will you know whether or not you were successful? Research appropriate ways to measure each of your specifications to precisely define success.

2. Poorly formatting specifications such that tables span across many pages.

| "I am a STEM teacher and bought a large quantity of these kits and I am disgusted by how easily the motor breaks. 12 years in STEM schools and this product is at the bottom of my list. The ladybug platform, as we call it, needs some reimagining and the materials simply can't handle the wear and tear of a classroom. Sad that I spend my own money on this with so little we got out of it." | 1.  The kit is robust. (explicit)                       |
