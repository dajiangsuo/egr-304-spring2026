## Assignment

1.  **Consult** with the instructor and instructional staff regarding your hardware/software/mechanical design draft. This may be done in class, in office hours, and/or by appointment.

2.  **Take notes.** These notes should consist of detailed feedback from instructors regarding the overall concept (*overall*), the look and feel (*layout*), and/or detailed feedback on part selection, errors, omissions, or problem areas (*detail*).

3.  **Construct a table of numbered action items** from your notes. Action items should start with a verb, e.g. "clarify power stage of piezoelectric subsystem with transistor part number and pinouts". Categorize each item of feedback as "overall", "layout", or "detail", along with the instructor that gave you that feedback. Ensure you have at least 5 overall comments, 5 layout comments, and 10 detailed comments.
